# Changelog

All notable changes to the blitz plugin are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.11.1] — 2026-05-02

Patch release driven by lessons from the first real `/blitz:sprint-dev` run on v1.11.0 (sprint-276 — 8 regressed `@mbk/web` test files). Two structural workload-sizing gaps surfaced; both are now fixed. Also addresses an orchestrator hallucination in sprint-review that misreported the Cross-Model Critic install state.

### Fixed

- **`skills/sprint-dev/SKILL.md` — per-wave file cap.** The existing 4-stories-per-agent cap allowed sprint-276 to assign one test-writer 8 files (3 stories: 2 + 1 + 5). At ~5-7 tool calls per file, that's 48-56 tool calls — exhausts Heavy-class budget mid-work. Added a complementary **6-files-per-agent-per-wave** cap; whichever bites first triggers the split. Sprint-dev now refuses to pack a 5-file story alongside two 1-file siblings even though story count = 3.
- **`skills/sprint-plan/SKILL.md` §3.1.1 — bulk-story guard tightened.** The file-count heuristic was `> 8 files → mandatory split`. The 5-file S276-003 story sat in the gap between the 1-3 file granularity target and the 8-file guard, slipping through unsplit. Replaced with a two-band heuristic: `> 5` is mandatory split (was `> 8`); `4-5` is soft warn with a `decision` event log; `1-3` is green (matches §3.1 target).
- **`skills/_shared/spawn-protocol.md` — Resume Protocol.** New canonical `SendMessage` payload for resuming a budget-exhausted (PARTIAL) agent. Must include `COMPLETED` (verbatim from prior reply), `REMAINING` (original task list minus completed), `WORKTREE`, `HEAD`, and `DO NOT` (re-explore, re-read, re-test) lists. Without it, resumed agents burn ~60% of fresh budget rebuilding context — exactly what re-exhausted S276-003 on first SendMessage. If the prior PARTIAL marker is missing or malformed, spawn fresh instead — stateless restart is cheaper than confused continuation.
- **`skills/sprint-review/references/main.md` §Invariant 7 — explicit mode-resolution algorithm.** During the v1.11.0 dual-CMC sprint-review run, the orchestrator emitted *"Critic agent available (sonnet, in-Claude only — critic-gemini.sh not installed in this plugin version)"* despite both `critic-gemini.sh` and the `gemini` binary being present. Replaced the implicit logic with a 4-step probe (env intent → script existence → binary existence → resolve) and a single canonical `[critic] mode=...` line. Each fallback path produces a precise diagnostic ("gemini binary missing" vs "critic-gemini.sh missing — plugin <v1.11.0?"); orchestrators are forbidden from improvising the message.

### Documentation

- **All skills with sparse `argument-hint:` frontmatter expanded** — 12 skills (`roadmap`, `review`, `ship`, `doc-gen`, `release`, `perf-profile`, `dep-health`, `quality-metrics`, `sprint`, `setup`, `code-doctor`, `conform`) now describe each mode/flag inline in the slash-command UI rather than just naming them. Matches the richer pattern already used by `browse`, `ui-audit`, and `code-sweep`. No behavioral change.

### Compatibility

No breaking changes. Drop-in upgrade from v1.11.0.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-05-01

The "autonomous holistic-machine" release. Two research investigations (`docs/_research/2026-05-01_skills-to-agents-architecture.md` and `docs/_research/2026-05-01_autonomous-blitz-quality-efficiency.md`) drove a six-wave implementation: P0 anti-shortcut hooks, token-efficiency protocol, autonomy primitives (PreCompact handoff + auto-resume), critic adversarial review, frontend-design integration, and a top-level orchestrator agent that provides freeform-input routing alongside the existing slash commands.

### Added

- **`agents/orchestrator.md`** — top-level holistic-machine router. Receives freeform input ("research X", "implement the sprint"), surfaces in-flight state from `.cc-sessions/HANDOFF.json` + activity-feed, and routes to the right slash skill. Activated via new `.claude-plugin/settings.json {"agent": "orchestrator"}` (Claude Code ≥2.1.117). Slash commands bypass the orchestrator and run unchanged. Disable per-session via `BLITZ_DISABLE_ORCHESTRATOR=1`. Read-only by construction (no Write/Edit/Agent — subagents cannot spawn subagents).
- **`agents/critic.md`** — read-only adversarial pre-PASS reviewer (Read/Grep/Glob/Bash only). Runs the 19-detector shortcut taxonomy + ratchet + acceptance-checks + hallucinated-symbol spot-check. Returns canonical JSON `{verdict: LGTM | REJECT}`. `sprint-review` Phase 3.6 Invariant 7 cannot reach PASS without LGTM.
- **`agents/design-critic.md`** — vision-model design-quality scorer (5 dimensions 0-10: Prompt Adherence, Aesthetic Fit, Visual Polish, UX, Creative Distinction). Reads `/tmp/ui-build-screenshots/*.png` against `DESIGN.md` or `frontend-design-heuristics.md`. Verdicts PASS/ITERATE/REWORK. Wired into `ui-build` Phase 5.4.2 with `design_quality: skip|standard|high` story switch.
- **`skills/design-extract/SKILL.md`** — reads brownfield project tokens (Tailwind config, CSS variables, font sources, accent-color usage) and emits `DESIGN.md` (Google Labs Apache-2.0 spec). Bootstraps the design-critic / ui-build / frontend-design pipeline.
- **7 anti-shortcut hooks** (all `exit 2` blocking, registered in `hooks/hooks.json`):
  - `block-no-verify.sh` — blocks `git commit --no-verify`. Emergency override `BLITZ_OVERRIDE_NO_VERIFY=1` (logged). Closes anthropics/claude-code#40117 (March 2026 incident: 6 commits with 63 failing tests landed via --no-verify).
  - `block-destructive-git.sh` — blocks `git reset --hard`, `checkout -- .`, `clean -f`, force-push to main, `branch -D` on current branch when working tree dirty.
  - `block-destructive-sql.sh` — blocks DROP TABLE / DELETE FROM-no-WHERE / TRUNCATE / FLUSHDB / Mongo `.drop()` outside migration paths. Closes Cursor+Railway production-DB deletion class.
  - `block-test-deletion.sh` — blocks `rm` of test files, renames test→non-test, Write that drops all assertions to zero.
  - `post-edit-typecheck-block.sh` — runs `tsc --noEmit` after Write to .ts/.vue and rejects edit if error count rose vs `.cc-sessions/typecheck-baseline.json`. Replaces always-exit-0 behavior for type errors specifically.
  - `block-as-any-insertion.sh` — PreToolUse on Write/Edit/MultiEdit. Counts `as any` / `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-nocheck` deltas in non-test source. Blocks introductions without an inline `// blitz:any-allowed: <reason>` justification (escape hatch from `shortcut-taxonomy.md` §4).
  - `block-test-disabling.sh` — PreToolUse on Write/Edit/MultiEdit to test files. Blocks insertions of `.skip(`, `.only(`, `xit`, `xdescribe`, `xtest`, `test.todo(` without an inline `// blitz:skip-pinned: #<issue>` justification.
- **`skills/_shared/token-budget.md`** — model routing (60% Haiku / 35% Sonnet / 5% Opus), mandatory `cache_control: {ttl: "1h"}` on orchestrator system prompts ≥1024 tokens (default 5min TTL — silently dropped from 60min — is net negative without opt-in). Canonical JSON subagent reply contract. Lazy skill loading. Deferred MCP via ToolSearch. Combined target: 50-70% cut on top of 15× multi-agent baseline.
- **`skills/_shared/ratchet-protocol.md`** — 7 monotonic quality metrics (`test_count`, `type_errors`, `as_any_count`, `lint_violations`, `completeness_score`, `mocks_in_src`, `todo_count`). `docs/sweeps/ratchet.json` schema. Tighten-on-improvement, never loosen. Multi-agent worktree merge takes `min(max_allowed)` deterministically. Auto-revert on deterministic regression; test_count regressions only flag (could be flaky removal).
- **`skills/_shared/shortcut-taxonomy.md`** — 19-detector catalog with canonical grep patterns, severity tiers (P0/P1/P2/P3), false-positive escape hatches.
- **`skills/_shared/knowledge-protocol.md`** + bootstrapped **`.cc-sessions/KNOWLEDGE.md`** — cross-session lessons format (`Context / Lesson / How to apply`). Append-only paragraphs. Injected into autonomous-loop dispatches. Pruned at 500 lines; archived past 365 days. `.gitignore`d by default. Three seed entries about plugin-agent restrictions, subagent-spawn constraints, the cache TTL pitfall.
- **`skills/_shared/frontend-design-heuristics.md`** — paraphrased Anthropic frontend-design philosophy (license-safe; upstream ships under non-standard `LICENSE.txt`). 13-tone selector, NEVER list (Inter/Roboto/Arial/Space Grotesk + purple-on-white + uniform corners + all-centered + default Tailwind palette).
- **`skills/_shared/agent-routing.md`** — orchestrator routing decision tree. Documents the constraint that subagents cannot spawn subagents; super-orchestrator skills stay slash-invoked. 4-class skill taxonomy with per-class routing rule.
- **`.claude-plugin/settings.json`** — activates `orchestrator` as plugin main-thread agent.
- **`spawn-protocol.md` §9 + §3 additions** — Token Budget & Reply Contract; WRAP_UP signal at 70% context ceiling; three-tier timeout (soft 20m / idle 10m / hard 30m); stuck-loop detection via dispatch-history pattern match.
- **`pre-compact-snapshot.sh` HANDOFF.json extension** — every PreCompact event now writes `.cc-sessions/HANDOFF.json` (sprint/phase/branch/head_sha/uncommitted/recent_files/last_activity/resume_hint). Generic resume artifact, not sprint-specific.
- **`session-start.sh` auto-resume** — surfaces fresh HANDOFF.json (≤24h) with one-line state summary; user opts to resume or archives.
- **`sprint-review` Phase 3.6 Invariants 6 + 7** — ratchet-regression hard gate + critic LGTM hard gate. Detailed procedures in `references/main.md`.
- **`ui-build` Phase 3.0 + 5.4.2** — mandatory aesthetic-direction step before wireframe (or invoke `frontend-design:frontend-design`); design-critic vision-iteration loop with up-to-3 revisions on `design_quality: high` stories. Implementation Gate gains banned-font + `prefers-reduced-motion` + `console.log`-zero + inline-style-ban checks.
- **`completeness-gate` §2.13 + §2.14** — new env-var-fallback detector (matches `process.env.X || '...'` near credential-named identifiers; Major severity in `src/`) and hardcoded-localhost / port detector (matches `https?://localhost|127.0.0.1|0.0.0.0` and 4-5-digit ports outside test fixtures and dev configs). Both have inline escape hatches (`// blitz:fallback-allowed:`, `// blitz:localhost-allowed:`).
- **`story-frontmatter.md` `acceptance_checks:` schema** — optional executable-predicate array for stories. Four check types: `grep_present` (with `min`), `grep_absent`, `shell` (with `assert_eq`), `ast_absent` (best-effort tree-sitter). `agents/critic.md` §2.5 contains the dispatcher; sprint-review Phase 3.6 Invariant 7 routes through it. Producer/consumer matrix updated with the new fields and the optional `design_quality:` enum (`skip` | `standard` | `high`).
- **`agents/research-critic.md`** — read-only adversarial citation+claim reviewer for `/blitz:research` Phase 3.2.5. Probes every cited URL via WebFetch, classifies LIVE / DEAD / LIKELY_HALLUCINATED / UNKNOWN per arxiv 2604.03173 urlhealth taxonomy. Verifies `> "..."` quoted spans appear in fetched source content (Deterministic Quoting). Returns `{verdict: PASS | CITATIONS_MISSING}`. CITATIONS_MISSING blocks cleanup so the user can inspect dead URLs before the findings dir is deleted.
- **`hooks/scripts/agent-frontmatter-validate.sh`** — sibling of `skill-frontmatter-validate.sh` for `agents/*.md`. Enforces required fields (`name` / `description` / `model` / `tools` / `maxTurns`), forbids silently-stripped plugin-agent fields (`hooks` / `mcpServers` / `permissionMode`), caps body at 500 lines, requires canonical OUTPUT STYLE snippet (or `[CANONICAL PREAMBLE]` inheritance marker). Wired into `PostToolUse` alongside the skill validator.
- **`hooks/scripts/critic-gemini.sh`** — Cross-Model Critic (CMC) wrapper per arxiv 2604.19049. Wraps `@google/gemini-cli`, lifts the in-Claude critic body verbatim (`--mode pre-pass | research | design`), appends a JSON-only directive, validates the reply matches the canonical reply contract, exits 0 on LGTM/PASS or 2 on REJECT/CITATIONS_MISSING. `sprint-review` Phase 3.6 Invariant 7 supports three modes: default (in-Claude only), `BLITZ_USE_GEMINI_CRITIC=1` (Gemini replaces in-Claude), `BLITZ_DUAL_CRITIC=1` (both must LGTM, ~2× cost, highest signal). Tunable via `BLITZ_GEMINI_BIN`, `BLITZ_GEMINI_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-pro`), `BLITZ_GEMINI_FLAGS`. Graceful failure when binary missing.

### Changed

- **`agents/doc-writer.md` → model: haiku** — mechanical pattern-following per the new routing matrix. ~5× per-output-token saving vs prior Sonnet default.
- **architect / backend-dev / frontend-dev / reviewer / test-writer** — added explicit model rationale comments per `token-budget.md`. Models unchanged (sonnet); now self-documenting.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — describes the orchestrator entry point, 5 new shared protocols, 7-invariant Phase 3.6 gate, 27-hook count (was 19). Stays under the 200-line CLAUDE.md token-budget rule.
- **8 specialist agents updated to canonical OUTPUT STYLE snippet** — replaces the prior `**Output style:**` paraphrase across architect / backend-dev / critic / design-critic / doc-writer / frontend-dev / reviewer / test-writer to satisfy Invariant 5 unification across `skills/` and `agents/`.
- **README.md** — new "Holistic Machine" section documenting orchestrator, quality gates, and Cross-Model Critic with full Gemini setup. Skills/agents/hooks/protocols counts updated. Architecture tree expanded for v1.11+ artifacts.
- **Skill count**: 38 (was 37; added `design-extract`).
- **Agent count**: 10 plugin agents (was 6; added `orchestrator`, `critic`, `design-critic`, `research-critic`).
- **Hook count**: 27 scripts (was 19; added 7 anti-shortcut blockers + `agent-frontmatter-validate.sh`).
- **Shared-protocol count**: 20 files (was 14; added `token-budget`, `ratchet-protocol`, `shortcut-taxonomy`, `knowledge-protocol`, `frontend-design-heuristics`, `agent-routing`).

### Compatibility

- Compatibility floor for orchestrator-activation features remains `>=2.1.117`. P0 hooks have no version dependency.

### Migration notes

1. The orchestrator activation is plugin-default. Per-project override: set `{"agent": null}` in your `.claude/settings.json`, or env `BLITZ_DISABLE_ORCHESTRATOR=1`.
2. Ratchet bootstraps on the first `sprint-review` PASS in a project; greenfield starts at 0 and tightens.
3. The 5 P0 hooks fire on any Bash command in a blitz-aware project. False positives surface via `BLITZ_OVERRIDE_*` env vars (documented in each hook's stderr message).
4. `KNOWLEDGE.md` is `.gitignore`d by default; team-shared lessons go in a separate committed `docs/engineering-notes.md`.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-04-26

Eleven follow-up commits after the v1.9.0 overhaul, capped by the new `/blitz:conform` skill that brings legacy projects into current spec. No breaking changes; one new feature, one regression fix, broad conformance tightening, and preventive coverage.

### Added

- **`/blitz:conform` skill** (`skills/conform/`) — detects + fixes drift in an existing project's blitz runtime artifacts against the canonical schemas in `skills/_shared/`. Schema-version aware: detects pre-v1.9.0 story frontmatter (`epic` + `verify` + `done`) and migrates to current spec (`epic_id` + `acceptance_criteria` + `registry_entries`) while preserving project-specific extension fields. Three-format STATE.md parser (field-form / bold-prefix-line / table-form). Optional-feature semantics (carry-forward and developer-profile absent + zero consumer signals = NO ACTION, not MISSING). Session model flexibility (file-style `<id>.json` AND directory-style `<id>/`). Sample mode auto-engages on >50 sprints or >300 stories (random sample of latest-3 + 10 older via `shuf`, with extrapolation). Project-extension awareness (39+ non-canonical roadmap files like `roadmap-registry.json`, `.bak` archives stay INFO, never deleted). Read-only by default; `--fix` applies migrations idempotently with per-file `.pre-conform.<ts>` backups. Plugin-fork mode via `--scope plugin`. Dry-run validated against a 123-sprint / 1,018-story / 160-session project. Skill 285 lines + references/main.md 288 lines.
- **`hooks/scripts/markdown-link-validate.sh`** — pre-commit warn-only hook for broken relative `.md` links across `skills/`. Strips fenced code blocks, inline code, http URLs, anchors, `/_shared/` plugin-absolute links. Closes the gap that allowed pass-3's renames to silently break links until pass-4 swept them.
- **`hooks/scripts/README.md`** — discoverability index for the 19 hook scripts. Tables grouped by hook event with matcher + purpose + blocking-vs-non-blocking conventions.
- **`scripts/maint/v1.9.0/`** — archived 5 migration scripts that performed the v1.9.0 mechanical work (`blitz-restructure.py`, `blitz-trim-preamble.py`, `blitz-rewrite-desc.py`, `blitz-fix-frontmatter.sh`, `blitz-xref-audit.py`) plus README documenting each script's purpose, idempotency contract, and re-run safety. Now also referenced by `/blitz:conform --scope plugin`.

### Fixed

- **🔴 sprint-review Invariant 5 silent regression** (`sprint-review/SKILL.md`) — Phase 3.6 audit script grepped `skills/*/reference.md`, which matched zero files post-v1.9.0 restructure. Invariant silently passed for any missing OUTPUT STYLE snippet. Updated all 4 path references (lines 389, 405, 419, 420) to `skills/*/references/main.md`. Now correctly identifies 8 references/main.md files with embedded agent-prompt templates.
- **`reference-compression-validate.sh` find pattern** — `find -name 'references/main.md.original'` never matched (slash in `-name`); switched to `-path '*/references/main.md.original'`. Hook now correctly checks all 16 .original/main.md pairs.
- **`installer/install.sh` banner version drift** — banner read `v1.4.1 · 33 skills · 12 hooks` (5 versions stale); now `v1.10.0 · 36 skills · 19 hooks`. Caught by `check-version-sync.sh`, which had been emitting warnings on every commit.
- **README hook count drift** — said "17 hooks" in 3 places; now 19 (added `skill-frontmatter-validate.sh` in v1.9.0 + `markdown-link-validate.sh` in v1.10.0).
- **Hook script JSON-escaping bugs** — `blitz-prompt-expansion.sh` and `post-compact-log.sh` used `printf`/sed pipelines for activity-feed JSON; rewritten with `jq -nc --arg` for safe escaping.
- **`session-start.sh` portability** — added portable epoch parser (GNU `date -d` → BSD `date -j` → python3 fallback) for stale-session detection. Per-session context counter now reset on `SessionStart` (was monotonically accumulating across sessions).
- **`task-completed-validate.sh` regex** — story-id check `^S\d+-\d+:` now accepts gap-fix IDs `^S\d+-G?\d+:` (e.g., `S3-G001`).
- **`sprint-review` allowed-tools** — removed unused `ToolSearch` declaration (per-skill manual audit confirmed zero invocations in body).

### Changed

- **All `disable-model-invocation: true` flags removed** — 5 skills (`ask`, `quick`, `next`, `health`, `codebase-audit`) are now eligible for description-based auto-invocation. Added `allowed-tools` to the 4 that previously omitted it (was implied by the disable flag): `ask` (Read, Bash, Glob, AskUserQuestion), `quick` (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep), `next` (Read, Bash, Glob, Grep), `health` (Read, Bash, Glob, Grep). `codebase-audit` already had `allowed-tools` declared.
- **Companion file restructure to canonical Anthropic layout** — 46 file moves: `reference.md` → `references/main.md` (27 skills + 16 `.original` siblings), `ui-audit/CHECKS.md` → `references/checks.md`, `ui-audit/PATTERNS.md` → `references/patterns.md`, `setup/conflict-catalog.json` → `assets/conflict-catalog.json`. 202 cross-reference substitutions across 30 files.
- **Inline duplication trim** — 21 SKILL.md files had a verbose ~500-char session-registration preamble inlined; replaced with a canonical ~270-char citation referencing `/_shared/session-protocol.md` §Session Registration and `/_shared/verbose-progress.md`. ~5.4 KB saved per session start.
- **Description triggerability rewrite** — every skill's `description:` field rewritten in third-person + front-loaded explicit trigger phrases for better Claude Code skill discovery.
- **Stale `reference.md` string sweep** — pass-3 markdown-link regex missed 15 path-fragment refs in 12 files (cross-skill cites in compress/quality-metrics/doc-gen/roadmap/review SKILLs, self-references inside moved files, fixture script comments). All cleaned; one intentional historical narrative preserved in `_shared/story-frontmatter.md`.
- **`agent-prompt-boilerplate.md` self-consistency** — protocol's own 7 internal `reference.md` paths updated to `references/main.md` (it's actively cited from 7 references/main.md files via `<!-- import: -->` markers).
- **`state-handoff.md` consumer wiring (3 → 7)** — added citations in `bootstrap`, `ship`, `roadmap`, `next` SKILL.md (was only sprint-plan/dev/review). Pipeline contract now visible to every producer/consumer.
- **CLAUDE.md Hooks section** — replaced single sentence with event-grouped overview (8 events × 19 scripts) and link to new `hooks/scripts/README.md`. Added `agent-prompt-boilerplate.md` to "Required for skills that spawn agents".
- **README hooks table + architecture diagram** — both now accurately list 19 scripts with one-line purposes; added `conform/` to named-skill list; new "Conforming after upgrades" subsection in Runtime Artifacts pointing at `/blitz:conform`.

### Audit findings (no code change)

- **`allowed-tools` precision audit** — manual per-skill review across all 37 SKILL.md files via spawned Explore agent + spot-check verification: 31 CLEAN, 4 EXEMPT (no `allowed-tools` field; ask/health/next/quick previously had `disable-model-invocation: true`), 1 EXTRA fixed (sprint-review ToolSearch removed), 0 true MISSING (the initial heuristic flag list of 14 was entirely false positives).
- **Markdown link health** — 72 relative `.md` links across `skills/`, all valid (now enforced on every commit by `markdown-link-validate.sh`).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-04-26

### Skill Suite Overhaul to Anthropic-Canonical Conventions

A full review of all 36 skills against Anthropic's official Skill authoring guidance (`code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`, `platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices`, `github.com/anthropics/skills`) and the production carry-forward / sprint-family contracts. Every skill now satisfies a single canonical contract enforced by a new lint hook.

### Breaking

- **Removed `.claude-plugin/skill-registry.json`** — non-canonical per Anthropic; skills are now auto-discovered from `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The only consumer (`skills/health/SKILL.md` Phase 3.1) was rewritten to walk SKILL.md files directly via the new lint hook.

### Added

- **`skills/_shared/story-frontmatter.md`** (NEW) — single canonical YAML schema for sprint stories. Producer/consumer matrix (sprint-plan writes; sprint-dev/sprint-review read). Validation algorithm (sprint-dev Phase 0). Closes the producer/consumer drift that contributed to the CAP-133 carry-forward incident.
- **`skills/_shared/state-handoff.md`** (NEW) — pipeline contracts for every artifact passed between bootstrap → research → roadmap → sprint-plan → sprint-dev → sprint-review → ship. Documents the producer/consumer/required-by table and the Phase 0 input-validation pattern.
- **`skills/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md`** §Reader Algorithm — single executable script that consolidates Invariants 1, 2, 4 + rollover-ceiling escalation. Sprint-plan / sprint-review / roadmap / dashboards now shell out to one canonical implementation; thresholds no longer drift across skills.
- **`skills/_shared/spawn-protocol.md`** §8 Agent Output Contract — unified SUCCESS / PARTIAL / MALFORMED / EMPTY / MISSING / TIMEOUT classifications and standard gate thresholds (N=1 → ABORT @ 1; N=2-3 → ABORT @ 2; N≥4 → ABORT @ ⌈N/2⌉). PARTIAL retry policy. Validator script. Skills that spawn agents now share one threshold table.
- **`skills/_shared/terse-output.md`** §Canonical Exemptions List — single authoritative list of sections that always use full prose (Safety, Root Cause, Risks, Destructive ops, First-time onboarding, Migration notices). Skills must not redefine the exemption set.
- **`hooks/scripts/skill-frontmatter-validate.sh`** (NEW) — Anthropic-canonical lint. Checks required frontmatter fields, name length (≤64 chars + reserved-word ban), description length (≤1024 chars), body length (≤500 lines), `effort:` presence, `model:` presence when invokable, and verbatim OUTPUT STYLE snippet. Wired into `hooks.json` PostToolUse Write|Edit chain and `pre-commit-validate.sh`.
- **Phase 0.0 Input Gate** — added to `sprint-plan` and `sprint-dev`; hard-fails with the missing-artifact path AND the producer skill name when an upstream input is missing (no more cryptic "no roadmap registry" errors on greenfield projects).

### Changed

- **All 36 SKILL.md files** — every skill now satisfies the canonical frontmatter contract: `effort:` field present (low/medium/high), `model:` explicit when invokable (no `[1m]` inheritance), verbatim OUTPUT STYLE snippet from `/_shared/terse-output.md` immediately below the Additional Resources block. Bodies trimmed to ≤500 lines (sprint-plan and sprint-dev pushed redundant content to canonical shared docs and references/main.md).
- **`skills/sprint-plan/SKILL.md`** — Additional Resources cite story-frontmatter.md and state-handoff.md as load-bearing; Phase 2.4 cites spawn-protocol.md §8 Agent Output Contract instead of inline thresholds; Phase 1.4 lock cycle delegates to session-protocol.md §File-Based Locking Protocol.
- **`skills/sprint-dev/SKILL.md`** — Execution Mode now reads autonomy from `.cc-sessions/developer-profile.json` per session-protocol.md §Autonomy Levels (canonical: low → interactive, medium → checkpoint, high/full → autonomous-forced); Phase 0.0 gate validates upstream artifacts; Phase 3.1a registry write delegates to carry-forward-registry.md §Writers; Phase 3.5.0 integration-check **mandatory** (was "optional").
- **`skills/sprint-review/SKILL.md`** — Phase 3.6 invocation switched to canonical Reader Algorithm; Invariant 5 now scans **SKILL.md AND references/main.md** (was reference.md only) — every SKILL.md without the canonical OUTPUT STYLE snippet auto-fails. Phase 2.6 cites spawn-protocol.md §8.
- **`skills/sprint/SKILL.md`, `skills/implement/SKILL.md`, `skills/review/SKILL.md`** — orchestrators now declare `model: opus`, `effort: low`, `allowed-tools`; descriptions rewritten in third person with explicit trigger phrases.
- **`skills/health/SKILL.md`** — Phase 3.1 rewritten to walk `skills/*/SKILL.md` via the new lint hook (was: parse `skill-registry.json`).
- **`hooks/scripts/pre-commit-validate.sh`** — adds SKILL.md frontmatter validation gate on staged SKILL.md files. Commits with violations are blocked.
- **`hooks/hooks.json`** — added `skill-frontmatter-validate.sh --all` to the PostToolUse Write|Edit chain.

### Documentation

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — fixed skill count (31 → 36); dropped `skill-registry.json` reference; added the canonical SKILL.md contract description and an expanded shared-protocol cross-reference list.
- **`README.md`** — fixed protocol count (9 → 12); dropped `skill-registry.json` from the architecture diagram; expanded the Shared Protocols table with three new entries (story-frontmatter.md, state-handoff.md, agent-prompt-boilerplate.md / scheduling.md / session-report-template.md).
- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — version 1.6.0 → 1.9.0; description updated to "36 skills, 6 agents, 17 hook scripts".
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — version 1.8.0 → 1.9.0.

### Why This Matters

A fresh Claude Code session can now invoke any skill from its SKILL.md alone. The sprint family round-trips cleanly because producer (sprint-plan) and consumers (sprint-dev, sprint-review) share one schema. Agent failure thresholds no longer drift between skills — one Agent Output Contract governs all spawns. The carry-forward registry has one Reader Algorithm; impossible-to-diverge implementations replace three near-duplicates. The OUTPUT STYLE snippet is now enforced by lint on every SKILL.md, eliminating the silent drift that triggered Invariant 5 failures.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-04-25

### April 2026 CC Platform Feature Adoption

Six CC platform features from the research backlog (`docs/_research/2026-04-25_blitz-skill-alignment.md`) implemented across skills and hooks.

### Added

- **`PreCompact` / `PostCompact` hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/scripts/pre-compact-snapshot.sh` + `hooks/scripts/post-compact-log.sh`) — PreCompact fires before context compaction and writes a state snapshot (sprint number, wave progress, stories done/remaining, CF_ACTIVE count) to `.cc-sessions/compact-state.json`. PostCompact (async) reads the snapshot and appends a restoration hint to the activity feed so the next turn knows where to resume. Addresses the highest blitz failure mode: silent state loss during auto-compact on long sprints.
- **`UserPromptExpansion` hook** (`hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/scripts/blitz-prompt-expansion.sh`) — fires on every `blitz:*` slash command expansion, reads the last 5 substantive activity-feed events, and injects them as `additionalContext` into the expansion prompt. Gives every skill instant awareness of prior session state without relying on Claude reading CLAUDE.md manually.

### Changed

- **`skills/sprint-dev/SKILL.md`** Phase 3.2 — Monitoring loop now uses the `Monitor` tool (event-driven) as the primary progress-tracking mechanism. Agents append JSON lines to a sprint-scoped progress file; a `tail -f` monitor wakes the orchestrator on DONE/BLOCKED/wave_complete events, eliminating the per-turn polling cost on long sprints. `TaskList` polling retained as fallback when Monitor is unavailable.
- **`skills/sprint-dev/SKILL.md`** Phase 2.2 — Agent MCP scoping table added. When `.claude/agents/blitz-{backend,frontend,test}-dev.md` definitions exist, each agent is spawned with its typed `mcpServers` config (backend=Firestore/Firebase, frontend=Playwright, test=read-only). Falls back to full session MCP set if agent definition files are absent.
- **`skills/sprint-dev/SKILL.md`** Phase 4.11 (new) — `PushNotification` call at sprint completion: sends title, story counts, and GitHub URL as a mobile push via Remote Control. No-op when Remote Control is not configured.
- **`skills/ship/SKILL.md`** Phase 4.2 (new) — `PushNotification` call at ship completion: sends version, feature/fix counts, and release URL. No-op when Remote Control is not configured.
- **`skills/sprint/SKILL.md`** `--loop` flag — Documents CronCreate-backed scheduling tiers (session/desktop/cloud Routine) and adds `ScheduleWakeup` self-scheduling pattern for direct `--loop` invocations (skipped when `CLAUDE_CODE_LOOP_MANAGED=1`). Documents 7-day CronCreate session expiry; recommends cloud Routines for runs >7 days.
- **`skills/ui-audit/SKILL.md`** Loop mode — `ScheduleWakeup` pattern added to `--loop` table: each tick registers the next wakeup so the audit survives idle periods without a persistent terminal.
- **`.claude-plugin/skill-registry.json`** — version 1.4.0 → 1.5.0.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-25

### blitz:code-doctor + Research → Sprint Auto-Chain

New skill `blitz:code-doctor` audits framework-API correctness (Firestore, VueFire, Vue 3, Pinia) — detects anti-patterns, misuse, dead exports, and duplication candidates. Read-only by default; `--fix` applies low-risk auto-fixes.

Auto-chain closes the only blocking manual step in the blitz cycle: running `/research` then `/sprint` previously failed with "No roadmap. Run `/blitz:roadmap` first." because `sprint/SKILL.md` Pre-Flight never detected uningested `docs/_research/*.md`. Now `sprint` automatically detects and ingests research docs via `roadmap extend` before proceeding — in both normal and `--loop` modes. `next/SKILL.md` gains carry-forward registry awareness so it never reports "nothing to do" while active entries exist.

### Added

- **`blitz:code-doctor` skill** (`skills/code-doctor/`) — SKILL.md + reference.md. Opus orchestrator + sonnet Agent workers. Framework-API correctness audit: Firestore (misuse, subcollection patterns, transaction anti-patterns), VueFire (reactive binding correctness), Vue 3 (Options/Composition anti-patterns, reactivity misuse), Pinia (store coupling, action patterns). `--fix` mode for low-risk auto-fixes (read-only by default). Registered in skill-registry.json (`quality` category, `beta` maturity).
- **Research doc** `docs/_research/2026-04-25_blitz-skill-alignment.md` — full 3-agent cycle alignment analysis. Identified 3 skill gaps + 7 un-adopted April-2026 CC platform features. Scope block `cf-2026-04-25-sprint-from-research-autochain`.
- **Research doc** `docs/_research/2026-04-25_code-doctor-skill.md` — code-doctor capability research.

### Changed

- **`skills/sprint/SKILL.md`** — Loop Step 1 Observe gains `UNINGESTED` / `UNINGESTED_COUNT` detection (cross-checks `carry-forward.jsonl` to skip already-ingested docs, preventing duplicate-id hard-fail). Loop Step 2 decision tree gains row 0: "uningested research → roadmap extend, exit clean." Pre-Flight gains step 1b: auto-invokes `roadmap extend` in normal mode; fails loud on malformed `scope:` blocks.
- **`skills/research/SKILL.md`** — Phase 4.2 follow-up table reordered: `roadmap extend` first (mandatory ingestion step made explicit), `sprint` second (single-command auto-chain path), `sprint-plan` third.
- **`skills/next/SKILL.md`** — Phase 0 gains steps 0.6 (`CF_ACTIVE` / `CF_ESCALATED` reads from carry-forward registry) and 0.7 (`UNINGESTED_COUNT`). Decision tree gains rows 8b–8d: escalation banner for stuck entries, ingest-and-plan path, gap-closure path. `next` can no longer report "nothing to do" while carry-forward entries are active.
- **`.claude-plugin/skill-registry.json`** — code-doctor entry added; version 1.3.0 → 1.4.0.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-23

### ui-audit — Continuous Cross-Page Consistency & UX Auditor

New skill `blitz:ui-audit` fills a gap no mainstream tool covers: semantic cross-page data consistency ("dashboard says 47, list page says 46" detection). Visual-regression tools (Percy, Chromatic, Applitools) explicitly mask numeric changes as noise. This skill extracts labeled values via Playwright MCP `browser_evaluate`, persists to an append-only registry, and asserts invariants across pages, roles, events, and interactive elements.

Delivered across 3 sprints (Sprint 6–8) and 35 stories. Research: `docs/_research/2026-04-23_ui-audit-skill.md`. All 5 epics closed (E-008 foundation + E-009 quality/heuristics + E-010 interactive + E-011 events + E-012 role matrix).

### Added

- **`blitz:ui-audit` skill** (`skills/ui-audit/`) — SKILL.md + reference.md + CHECKS.md + PATTERNS.md + tests/. 9 modes: `full`, `smoke`, `data`, `buttons`, `events`, `consistency`, `heuristics`, `role <name>`, `--loop`. Opus orchestrator + effort:low + sonnet Agent workers for parallel heuristic scans when pages >30.
- **Labeled-value registry** at `docs/crawls/page-data-registry.jsonl` — append-only, latest-wins-by-`(role, page, label)` via `jq group_by`. Reader protocol excludes 10 finding-label families to prevent feedback on re-run.
- **Cross-page invariants** — `.ui-audit.json` declares `invariants` (`equal`/`gte`/`lte` with tolerance), `event_invariants` (`required_props`/`forbidden_props`/`scope`), `role_invariants` (`equal`/`viewer_null`/`gte`), plus `totals` parent/child sums, `placeholder_patterns`, `role_leak_patterns`.
- **Interactive element coverage** — enumerates every ARIA-role + native interactive element per page; runs 6 static checks (NO_LABEL, DEAD_HREF, EMPTY_HANDLER, TABINDEX_POSITIVE, TABINDEX_NEGATIVE_VISIBLE, NO_FOCUS_STATE) + destructive-classifier-gated safe-click pass + CLICK_ERROR capture.
- **Analytics event consistency** — 3-layer interception (`window.dataLayer` push proxy + `navigator.sendBeacon` wrap + network filter for Segment/PostHog/Amplitude/GA4). Cross-page event drift detection + `event_invariants` with 20-key PII auto-escalation list (CRITICAL on `user_email`/`password`/`ssn`/`token`/etc leaked in analytics).
- **Per-permissions-role audit matrix** — 5 roles (anonymous/viewer/member/admin/superadmin) via env-var credentials, scripted login with R9 sentinel check after every role transition, storageState harvest at `.auth/<role>.json`, HTML-source role-leak scan. Loop matrix = `(role, page)` per tick, 2-pass termination, R10 ETA gate (`--yes`/`--ci` bypass on >60min runs).
- **6 data-quality flags**: NULL_VALUE + PLACEHOLDER + NEGATIVE_COUNT (inline Phase 2) + FORMAT_MISMATCH + STALE_ZERO + BROKEN_TOTAL (Phase 4 reducers).
- **Vercel Web Interface Guidelines heuristics** — Category 9 (URL reflects filter/tab/pagination state, consumes click records) + Category 16 (NUMERIC_COLUMN_NOT_TABULAR via `getComputedStyle(cell).fontVariantNumeric` + WRITTEN_OUT_COUNT regex scan).
- **Self-contained fixture test** (`skills/ui-audit/tests/run-fixture.sh`) — python3 static server + synthetic HTML fixture + shell assertions for 6 numeric + 3 interactive + 2 event + 4 quality + 2 heuristic scenarios. Runs without Claude Code or Playwright MCP.
- **Phase 7 LOOP MATRIX** — role×page cursor persisted in `docs/crawls/latest-tick.json.ui_audit_matrix`; `matrix_idle: true` after pass-2 completion.
- **Prompt-injection defense** on Phase 5 sonnet worker spawn — page-key sanitization at config-load (reject control chars) + `---BEGIN/END PAGE LIST---` delimiters with literal-interpretation framing in prompt.

### Changed

- `skills/browse/reference.md` — `latest-tick.json` schema gains `page_data_registry` field so browse can observe ui-audit state in one read.
- `skills/_shared/session-protocol.md` — conflict matrix adds 3 ui-audit rows (BLOCK self / WARN vs browse-loop / OK vs sprint-dev).
- `.claude-plugin/skill-registry.json` — ui-audit entry, category `quality`, `dependencies: ["browse"]`, `maturity: "experimental"`.
- `skills/sprint-review/SKILL.md` — Invariant 5 floor bumped 7→8 (ui-audit/reference.md carries an agent-prompt template).
- Plugin skill count: 33 → 35 (ui-audit; one skill-review housekeeping).

### Fixed

Review auto-fixes that landed this cycle and hardened the design:

- Fixture `awk /dev/stdin <<<"$HTML"` bug — would silently null-out interactive assertions on WSL (sprint-7 pattern review).
- Safety-rule verb-list divergence — SKILL.md Rule 1 and `DESTRUCTIVE_LABELS` regex now share the full 24-verb list (sprint-7 security review).
- `--yes` / `--ci` arg-parse gap — ETA-gate flags now documented in Phase 0.1 mode table with explicit env-var export (sprint-7 security review).
- dataLayer proxy circular-ref crash — wrapped in try/catch; original `_push` always called last (sprint-7 security review).
- PII auto-escalation list expanded from 8 → 20 keys with substring match (`phone`, `address`, `dob`, `ip_address`, passport, reset codes, etc).
- Phase 3 reducer exclude-label divergence — CONSISTENCY + FLAPPING reducers now share the 10-label canonical exclude set (sprint-8 pattern review).
- URL-token capture in Cat 9 findings — `scrub_url` helper redacts `token|session|auth|key|secret|password|reset|code|nonce|state|access_token|refresh_token` values before emission; state-change signal preserved via symmetric redaction (sprint-8 security review).
- Worker malformed-JSON silent-drop — Phase 5 coordinator now validates each spawned worker's output with `jq -c '.'` and preserves malformed output as `.malformed.<ts>` with CONFIG_ERROR (sprint-8 security review).
- placeholder_patterns ReDoS guard — rejects patterns >200 chars or containing nested quantifiers at config-load (sprint-8 housekeeping).

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-18

### Caveman Full Absorption

Delivers the full 14-entry caveman-absorption work plan tracked in `docs/_research/2026-04-18_caveman-full-absorption.md` and `docs/_research/2026-04-18_runtime-artifact-terse-propagation.md`. Spans 4 sprints (Sprint 2-5) and 14 `/loop` ticks of autonomous sprint-plan/dev/review cycles. 12 of 14 registry entries landed complete; 2 dropped with documented reasons (preservation-boundary and supersede). Zero silent drops.

### Added

- **Terse-output directive coverage** across every load-bearing context (`agents/*.md` ×6, `skills/*/SKILL.md` ×31, `skills/_shared/*.md` ×11). Every context that spawns or reads instructions now cross-references `/_shared/terse-output.md`.
- **Runtime directive injection** at 8 SKILL.md write-phases (`research`, `sprint-plan`, `sprint-review`, `retrospective`, `roadmap`, `release`, `fix-issue`, `todo`). Inline 5-line Output-style block ensures generated artifacts default to terse prose rather than verbose defaults.
- **Caveman-review output format** in `skills/sprint-review/reference.md` and `skills/review/reference.md`. Finding pattern: `L<line>: <severity-prefix> <problem>. <fix>.` with 🔴/🟡/🔵/❓ prefixes. `LGTM` short-circuit. Auto-clarity for security/CVE findings.
- **Intensity persistence**: `output_intensity: lite|full|ultra` documented in `developer-profile.json`, `BLITZ_OUTPUT_INTENSITY` env override, precedence chain in `skills/_shared/terse-output.md` and interpolated into `spawn-protocol.md` §7 snippet.
- **LITE-intensity exemption markers** on 9 safety/reasoning-sensitive skills (`completeness-gate`, `codebase-audit`, `research`, `retrospective`, `sprint-review`, `release`, `migrate`, `fix-issue`, `bootstrap`). Prevents brevity-induced accuracy degradation per Renze 2024 + Prompt-Compression-in-the-Wild evidence.
- **Agent-prompt boilerplate shared fragment** at `skills/_shared/agent-prompt-boilerplate.md`. Canonical source for HEARTBEAT, PARTIAL, weight-class caps, session-registration preambles. Pattern A delivery (author-time reference; inline preserved per Invariant 5 safety).
- **Sprint-review Phase 3.6 Invariant 5** enforces OUTPUT STYLE snippet presence in every UNSAFE agent-prompt `reference.md`. Any missing snippet → Critical finding → sprint FAILs.
- **Activity-feed message length rule** in `skills/_shared/verbose-progress.md`: `message` ≤ 200 chars (soft) / 300 chars (grep audit threshold), overflow moves to `detail`.
- **Scope-block ingestion** scripts: `scripts/parse-scope-to-registry.py` and `scripts/backfill-registry-parents.py`. Used by `/blitz:roadmap` Phase 1.1.5 and Phase 7 backfill.
- **New skill directory**: `skills/review/reference.md` (previously missing; bonus delivery via S3-003).

### Changed

- `skills/_shared/spawn-protocol.md:328` — enforcement clause upgraded from `WARNING (not BLOCKER)` to hard BLOCKER. Paired with sprint-review Invariant 5.
- `skills/_shared/terse-output.md` — added `## Intensity override precedence` section documenting env > dev-profile > skill > default resolution.
- 18 input files compressed author-time (`/blitz:compress`): 6 SAFE `reference.md` (wave 2) + 12 `docs/_research/*.md`. Aggregate reduction ~-1.5% (~4 KB), scope-block YAML preserved byte-identical in all 6 research docs with `scope:` frontmatter.

### Fixed

- `skills/completeness-gate/reference.md` flagged UNSAFE at compression time (contains load-bearing `## Grep Patterns by Check` heading). Registry entry `cf-2026-04-18-compress-safe-references-wave2` transitioned to `dropped` with preservation-boundary rationale rather than forcing a partial delivery.

### Dropped (terminal, documented)

- `cf-2026-04-18-compress-safe-references-wave2` (0.857 coverage) — completeness-gate's grep-pattern heading is load-bearing; compression risk exceeds ~0.3% saving.
- `cf-2026-04-18-task-type-gating` — superseded by `cf-2026-04-18-lite-exemption-markers` (per-section markers are strictly more expressive than whole-skill `output_style_policy`). Capability-index `dedup_log` pre-announced the supersede at plan time.

### Documentation

- `docs/_research/2026-04-18_caveman-full-absorption.md` — 9 scope entries, 7 capabilities mapped into the roadmap.
- `docs/_research/2026-04-18_runtime-artifact-terse-propagation.md` — 5 scope entries, documents the 0%-runtime-reach propagation gap and its phased fix.
- `docs/roadmap/` — full roadmap ingested from the 2 research docs: 7 capabilities, 3 domains, 4 phases, 7 epics, 14 carry-forward registry entries with parent.capability + parent.epic backfill.
- 5 sprint scaffolds under `sprints/sprint-{1..5}/` with manifest, stories, STATE, ac-coverage, summary, and review-report per sprint.
- 16 GitHub issues (#1-#16) created across Sprint 2-5 for story tracking.

### Registry Contract

Carry-forward registry format (`.cc-sessions/carry-forward.jsonl`) validated across:

- 14 unique IDs with full `created` → `correction` → `progress` → `complete|dropped` lifecycle.
- Zero silent drops across 5 sprints.
- Zero rollover escalations (rollover_count capped at 2; `deferred` events used for scheduled-to-later entries).
- `Invariant 5` self-tested on its own dogfood at Sprint 5 review (7/7 UNSAFE `reference.md` carry the required snippet).
