# Research Skill

Investigate a topic by spawning parallel research agents, collecting findings, and synthesizing a structured research document. Execute every phase in order. Do NOT skip phases.

---

## Phase 0: PARSE TOPIC — Understand What to Research

### 0.0 Register Session

Follow [session-protocol.md](/_shared/session-protocol.md) §Session Registration (steps 1-9) and [verbose-progress.md](/_shared/verbose-progress.md). Print verbose progress at every phase transition, decision point, and skill-specific dispatch.

### 0.1 Extract Research Topic

Parse the user's request to identify:
- **Topic**: The primary subject to research (library, API, pattern, architecture decision, etc.)
- **Topic slug**: Lowercase, hyphenated version for file naming (e.g., `auth-strategy`, `state-machine-libs`)
- **Research type**: One of: Library Evaluation, Architecture Decision, Feature Investigation, Comparison (see references/main.md)
- **Scope constraints**: Any constraints the user mentioned (must work with X, needs Y, cannot use Z)
- **Decision context**: Why this research is needed (new feature, migration, performance issue, etc.)

### 0.2 Formulate Research Questions

Generate 3-6 specific research questions that must be answered. Examples:
- "Which library has the best TypeScript support?"
- "What are the breaking changes between v2 and v3?"
- "How does this integrate with the detected framework?"
- "What is the performance impact at scale?"
- "What are the security implications?"

### 0.3 Build Codebase Context

Quick scan of the project to understand constraints:
```bash
# Check for relevant existing implementations
find . -maxdepth 3 -name 'package.json' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' | head -10
```
- Read root `package.json` to identify existing dependencies
- Note the detected stack profile (framework, build system, package manager)
- Identify any existing code related to the research topic

---

## Phase 1: SPAWN RESEARCH AGENTS — Parallel Investigation

### 1.1 Create Working Directory

```bash
RESEARCH_DIR="${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
rm -rf "${RESEARCH_DIR}"
mkdir -p "${RESEARCH_DIR}"
```

### 1.2 Determine Required Agents

Spawn 2-4 agents depending on the research type:

| Agent Name | Role | Always Spawned | Model | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `library-docs` | Library & Documentation Research | Yes | haiku | Official docs, API surface, version history, migration guides, known issues, changelogs |
| `web-researcher` | Web & Community Research (contrarian role) | Yes | haiku | Blog posts, GitHub issues, benchmarks, community sentiment, **counter-evidence + post-mortems** |
| `codebase-analyst` | Codebase Analysis | Yes | sonnet | Existing patterns, integration points, migration impact, affected files, dependency graph |
| `infra-analyst` | Infrastructure Analysis | Conditional (§1.2.5) | haiku | Cloud service docs, pricing, quotas, deployment implications, environment config |

Model routing follows [token-budget.md](../_shared/token-budget.md): retrieval-class workloads (library-docs, web-researcher, infra-analyst) → Haiku 4.5 (12× cheaper than Sonnet, comparable hallucination rate per arxiv 2604.03173). Semantic codebase reasoning (codebase-analyst) → Sonnet 4.6.

### 1.2.5 Spawn-N Gate (skip unneeded agents)

`infra-analyst` is conditional — spawn only when stack has cloud/infra concerns:

```bash
SPAWN_INFRA=false
# Detect via package.json deps + CLAUDE_PLUGIN env
if grep -qE '"(firebase|firebase-admin|@google-cloud|aws-sdk|@aws-sdk|@azure|stripe|twilio)"' package.json 2>/dev/null \
   || grep -qE 'firebase\.json|wrangler\.toml|serverless\.yml|terraform/' . 2>/dev/null; then
  SPAWN_INFRA=true
fi

# Override: user can force via env var
[ "${BLITZ_RESEARCH_FORCE_INFRA:-0}" = "1" ] && SPAWN_INFRA=true

[ "$SPAWN_INFRA" = false ] && echo "[research] infra-analyst skipped (no cloud/infra detected; set BLITZ_RESEARCH_FORCE_INFRA=1 to override)" >&2
```

Saves ~$0.10/run on ~40% of runs (token-economics §9 Gap 6).

### 1.3 Spawn Agents via Agent Tool

Spawn each agent in **a single assistant message** (so they run concurrently) using the `Agent` tool with:

- `subagent_type: general-purpose` (agents must Write findings files; `Explore` is read-only and silently fails the write)
- `model: sonnet` (explicit — prevents `[1m]` inheritance from the Opus orchestrator)
- `description: research <agent-name>`
- `prompt`: the agent prompt template from Section 1.5 below, filled with topic, questions, output path, and stack profile
- `run_in_background: true` (orchestrator polls output files in Phase 1.7)

Each agent prompt MUST include:

1. **Research topic and questions** — Full context of what to investigate.
2. **Detected stack profile** — So findings are relevant to the project.
3. **Output file path** — `${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research/<agent-name>.md`
4. **Research limits** — See below.
5. **Write-as-you-go rule** — "Stub your output file with `# IN PROGRESS` before your first tool call. Append findings as you discover them. Do NOT accumulate in memory."

Cross-cutting findings are NOT routed peer-to-peer. The orchestrator synthesizes cross-domain findings in Phase 2 from the written output files. (The previous STEER: SendMessage protocol was removed in v1.4.0 — it was advisory-only, had no ack mechanism, and findings could be silently truncated when the receiving agent was near its output budget.)

### 1.5 Research Limits Per Agent

Each agent must respect these limits to stay focused:

| Agent | Max Web Searches | Max Files Read | Max Output Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| `library-docs` | 8 | 5 | 200 lines |
| `web-researcher` | 10 | 3 | 200 lines |
| `codebase-analyst` | 0 | 15 | 150 lines |
| `infra-analyst` | 6 | 8 | 150 lines |

### 1.6 Agent Prompt Templates

The 4 templates share a canonical preamble (OUTPUT STYLE + BUDGET + WRITE-AS-YOU-GO + JSON reply contract) so agents return parseable status to the orchestrator and write findings to a file. Full preamble + per-agent role text live in [`references/main.md`](references/main.md) §Agent Prompt Templates — paste from there into each Agent() spawn. Orchestrator MAY mark the canonical preamble `cache_control: {type: "ephemeral", ttl: "1h"}` once the total static prefix crosses 1024 tokens (after Haiku-routing migration).

**Templates by role** (all consume the canonical preamble; differences below):
- `library-docs` — model: haiku. Official docs, API surface, version compat. Citation rule: structured entries, no `[QUOTE_UNVERIFIED]` text.
- `web-researcher` — model: haiku. **Contrarian role** assigned (counter-evidence focus to mitigate agent-agreement bias per arxiv 2604.02923).
- `codebase-analyst` — model: sonnet. Semantic codebase reasoning, no web search. file:LINE cites.
- `infra-analyst` — model: haiku. **Conditional** (§1.2.5 spawn-N gate). Cloud + deployment.

Cross-cutting findings are NOT routed peer-to-peer. The orchestrator synthesizes cross-domain findings in Phase 2 from the written output files. (The previous STEER: SendMessage protocol was removed in v1.4.0 — it was advisory-only, had no ack mechanism, and findings could be silently truncated when the receiving agent was near its output budget.)

### 1.7 Wait for Completion

Poll for agent completion by checking output files:
```bash
for f in ${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research/*.md; do
  [ -s "$f" ] && echo "DONE: $f" || echo "PENDING: $f"
done
```

**Timeout:** If any agent has not produced output after 3 minutes, mark it as failed and proceed with available findings.

---

## Phase 2: COLLECT AND VALIDATE — Gather All Findings

### 2.1 Classify Outputs (canonical gate from spawn-protocol §8)

Run the standard classifier BEFORE reading findings. MISSING / EMPTY / MALFORMED outputs MUST NOT silently pass through as SUCCESS:

```bash
EXPECTED_OUTPUTS=(
  "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research/library-docs.md"
  "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research/web-researcher.md"
  "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research/codebase-analyst.md"
)
[ "$SPAWN_INFRA" = true ] && EXPECTED_OUTPUTS+=("${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research/infra-analyst.md")

# classify_output() and gate logic from /_shared/spawn-protocol.md §8
classify_output() {
  local f="$1"
  if [ ! -f "$f" ]; then echo MISSING; return; fi
  if [ ! -s "$f" ]; then echo EMPTY; return; fi
  if grep -q '^PARTIAL: true' "$f"; then
    grep -q '^COMPLETED:' "$f" && grep -q '^MISSING:' "$f" \
      && echo PARTIAL || echo MALFORMED
    return
  fi
  echo SUCCESS
}

declare -A COUNTS=()
for f in "${EXPECTED_OUTPUTS[@]}"; do
  c=$(classify_output "$f")
  COUNTS[$c]=$((${COUNTS[$c]:-0} + 1))
  echo "$f → $c"
done

MISSING_COUNT=$(( ${COUNTS[MISSING]:-0} + ${COUNTS[EMPTY]:-0} + ${COUNTS[MALFORMED]:-0} ))
N=${#EXPECTED_OUTPUTS[@]}
case $N in
  1) THRESHOLD=1 ;;
  2|3) THRESHOLD=2 ;;
  *) THRESHOLD=$(( (N + 1) / 2 )) ;;
esac

if [ "$MISSING_COUNT" -ge "$THRESHOLD" ]; then
  echo "[research] ABORT: $MISSING_COUNT/$N agents failed (threshold $THRESHOLD)" >&2
  # Do NOT clean up — preserve findings dir for inspection
  exit 1
fi
```

### 2.2 Summarize Each Agent File (Haiku — token saving)

Reading 4 raw 200-line agent files into the synthesizer costs ~100K input tokens (~$0.30 at Sonnet rates). Compress first via Haiku summarization-on-read (Pattern B from token-economics §5; saves ~$0.26/run, 22% of total cost):

```bash
for f in "${EXPECTED_OUTPUTS[@]}"; do
  [ "$(classify_output "$f")" = "SUCCESS" ] || continue
  Agent({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    model: "haiku",
    description: "Summarize $(basename $f .md) findings to ≤30 lines",
    prompt: "Read ${f}. Output ≤30 lines listing the most important findings as
             bullets. Preserve URLs, file:line refs, dates, version numbers verbatim.
             Drop prose. Write to ${f}.summary.md. Return canonical JSON reply with
             status + files_changed."
  })
done

# Synthesizer reads SUMMARIES, not raw findings
SYNTHESIS_INPUT_FILES=()
for f in "${EXPECTED_OUTPUTS[@]}"; do
  [ -f "${f}.summary.md" ] && SYNTHESIS_INPUT_FILES+=("${f}.summary.md") || SYNTHESIS_INPUT_FILES+=("$f")
done
```

If a Haiku summarizer fails or times out, fall back to the raw file for that agent — never skip the agent's findings entirely.

### 2.3 Cross-Reference Findings

Read `SYNTHESIS_INPUT_FILES` and surface:
- **Contradictions** — Does one agent's finding conflict with another's? Document explicitly in the `## Dissent / Contradictory Evidence` section of the produced doc — never silently collapse to consensus (mitigates agent-agreement bias per arxiv 2604.02923).
- **Gaps** — Are any research questions unanswered? Mark via §2.4.
- **Convergence** — Do multiple agents reach the same conclusion? Require ≥3 distinct source domains before treating consensus as established (single-domain consensus is rejected).

### 2.4 Gap Detection (1 Haiku call → optional second wave)

Before synthesis, check coverage:

```bash
GAPS=$(Agent({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "haiku",
  description: "Identify research-question gaps in summarized findings",
  prompt: "Read ${SYNTHESIS_INPUT_FILES[@]}. For each research question in:
           ${QUESTIONS}
           Return JSON array: [{q: '...', answered: bool, citations_count: int}].
           If answered: false OR citations_count < 2, flag as GAP."
}))
NUM_GAPS=$(echo "$GAPS" | jq '[.[] | select(.answered == false or .citations_count < 2)] | length')
ELAPSED_SEC=$(( $(date +%s) - SESSION_START ))

# One narrow second wave (max 2 agents) if budget allows
if [ "$NUM_GAPS" -gt 0 ] && [ "$NUM_GAPS" -le 2 ] && [ "$ELAPSED_SEC" -lt 600 ]; then
  echo "[research] $NUM_GAPS gap(s) detected; spawning narrow second wave" >&2
  # Spawn a Haiku web-researcher per gap, scoped to that single question
  echo "$GAPS" | jq -c '.[] | select(.answered == false or .citations_count < 2)' | head -2 | while read -r gap; do
    GAP_Q=$(echo "$gap" | jq -r '.q')
    # Agent({...}) spawn here — scope: this single question, max 5 web searches, output to .gap-N.md
  done
fi
```

If gap-fill agents return findings, append summaries to `SYNTHESIS_INPUT_FILES` before synthesis. If still gaps remain, the synthesizer surfaces them in the doc's `## Open questions` section.

---

## Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE — Produce Research Document

### 3.1 Generate Research Document

Write the final research document to:
```
docs/_research/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic-slug>.md
```

Create the directory if it does not exist:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/_research
```

**Output style:** terse-technical per [/_shared/terse-output.md](/_shared/terse-output.md). Drop articles, fillers, pleasantries, hedging. Preserve verbatim: code fences, paths, commands, grep patterns, YAML/JSON frontmatter (especially `scope:`), tables, error codes, dates, versions. No preamble, no trailing summary. Fragments OK. Intensity: `lite` for user-facing Summary + Research-Questions + Risks (reasoning chain must survive); `full` for Findings narrative + Implementation Sketch. Auto-pause for security/irreversible/root-cause sections — write full prose.

**Terse exemptions (LITE intensity):** §7 Risks section + Open Questions (reasoning chain must survive compression). Full sentences + reasoning chain required in these sections. Resume terse on next section.

Use the template from `references/main.md`. The document MUST include all of these sections:

1. **Summary** — 3-5 sentence executive summary of findings and recommendation.
2. **Research Questions** — The questions posed, each with a concise answer.
3. **Findings** — Detailed findings organized by theme (not by agent). Each finding must cite its source.
4. **Compatibility Analysis** — How the topic fits with the detected stack. Include version compatibility, dependency conflicts, and integration complexity.
5. **Recommendation** — Clear, actionable recommendation with rationale. If comparing options, include a comparison matrix.
6. **Implementation Sketch** — High-level steps to implement the recommendation, adapted to the detected stack. Include key code patterns, file locations, and configuration changes.
7. **Risks** — Known risks, mitigations, and open questions.
8. **References** — Links to documentation, articles, and discussions cited in the findings.

### 3.1.1 Emit Structured Scope (when quantified)

If any finding or recommendation contains a **quantified scope claim** — regex match: `\d+\s+(files|components|modals|routes|tests|endpoints|pages|views|tables|endpoints|migrations|fields|records)` in the Summary, Findings, or Recommendation sections — the research doc MUST include a `scope:` YAML frontmatter block at the top of the file, above the `# <title>` heading.

This block is the **machine-readable contract** that `roadmap extend` parses to create carry-forward registry entries. Without it, the quantified claim is prose and silently drops between sprints. With it, every uncovered item remains visible in planning inputs until completed, deferred, or dropped. See [carry-forward-registry.md](/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md) for the full registry protocol.

**Format:**

```yaml
---
scope:
  - id: cf-YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>
    unit: files                              # files | components | routes | tests | endpoints | ...
    target: 130                              # Integer count
    description: |
      Migrate all modal components in apps/web/src/ to @mbk/ui Modal.vue,
      removing the legacy class="modal-overlay" pattern and deprecating
      shared/ConfirmDialog.vue.
    acceptance:
      # Executable DoD — each check must be verifiable by completeness-gate
      # without human interpretation. Prefer grep/shell/AST over prose.
      - grep_absent: 'class="modal-overlay"'
      - grep_absent: 'from.*shared/ConfirmDialog'
      - grep_present:
          pattern: 'from.*@mbk/ui.*Modal'
          min: 30
---

# <Research Doc Title>
...
```

**Rules:**

1. **One entry per distinct quantified claim.** A doc that says "migrate 130 files AND add 4 new components AND fix 12 tests" must emit three `scope:` entries, not one bundled entry.
2. **The `id` must be unique across the registry.** Use the research doc date as the stem, e.g., `cf-2026-04-02-modal-consistency`. The roadmap extend step will reject duplicate ids.
3. **`acceptance` must be executable.** Prefer `grep_absent`, `grep_present` (with `min` count), `ast_absent`, or `shell` commands over checklist prose. A DoD that requires human interpretation to verify will not be audited and will fail Invariant 1 at sprint-review time.
4. **If scope cannot be quantified,** do not fake a number. Write an explicit HTML comment above the quantified language: `<!-- no-registry: <reason> -->`. Acceptable reasons include "scope is exploratory — will be quantified after spike story" or "scope is qualitative UX research with no countable artifacts." `sprint-review` Invariant 1 will honor this comment.
5. **When the research doc is later ingested** by `/blitz:roadmap extend`, each `scope:` entry becomes both (a) a `scope_metric` on the derived Capability in `capability-index.json` and (b) a registry line in `.cc-sessions/carry-forward.jsonl` with `status: active`, `delivered.actual: 0`, `coverage: 0.0`. The registry is then authoritative.

**Cross-check before writing the doc:** scan your own Summary, Findings, and Recommendation for quantified language. If you count the word "all" near a noun that has a knowable cardinality (e.g., "migrate all 130 modals"), that is a quantified scope claim and needs a `scope:` entry.

### 3.2 Quality Gates

Before finalizing:
- Every research question has an answer (even if "insufficient data").
- Recommendation is specific and actionable (not "it depends").
- Implementation sketch references real project paths and patterns.
- No agent's findings are silently dropped.
- **Scope block present** whenever the doc contains quantified scope language — or an explicit `<!-- no-registry: <reason> -->` comment. No un-registered quantified claims are allowed to land in `docs/_research/`.

### 3.2.5 Citation Validation (research-critic agent)

After §3.1 emits the draft research doc, spawn `agents/research-critic.md` to probe every cited URL via WebFetch HEAD-equivalent and verify quoted spans. Catches the documented 3-13% URL hallucination rate (arxiv 2604.03173) before the doc reaches downstream consumers like `/blitz:roadmap`:

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "blitz:research-critic",
  description: "Citation + claim validity probe",
  prompt: "Probe all citations in docs/_research/${TIMESTAMP}_${TOPIC_SLUG}.md.
           Return canonical JSON with verdict (PASS | CITATIONS_MISSING) and
           per-citation status (LIVE | DEAD | LIKELY_HALLUCINATED | UNKNOWN)."
})
```

If verdict is `CITATIONS_MISSING`:
- Surface failing citations to the user.
- Skip Phase 3.3 cleanup (preserve `${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research/` for inspection).
- Mark the doc with a `<!-- WARNING: citation-validity check failed; see issues below -->` comment.
- Do NOT auto-fix; let the user decide whether to retry, accept, or abandon.

Optional: `BLITZ_RESEARCH_NO_CRITIC=1` skips this phase (default-on for docs destined for `/blitz:roadmap` ingestion).

### 3.3 Clean Up (CONDITIONAL — preserve findings on failure)

```bash
DOC_PATH="docs/_research/${TIMESTAMP}_${TOPIC_SLUG}.md"
SYNTHESIS_OK=false
if [ -f "$DOC_PATH" ] && [ "$(wc -l < "$DOC_PATH")" -ge 50 ]; then
  # Doc exists and is substantive (≥50 lines)
  if [ "${CRITIC_VERDICT:-PASS}" = "PASS" ]; then
    SYNTHESIS_OK=true
  fi
fi

if [ "$SYNTHESIS_OK" = true ]; then
  rm -rf "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research"
else
  echo "[research] PRESERVING ${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/research for inspection (synthesis missing/short or critic flagged)" >&2
fi
```

---

## Phase 4: REPORT — Present to User

### 4.1 Output Summary

Print a concise summary to the user:

```
Research Complete: <topic>
========================
Document: docs/_research/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic-slug>.md
Agents: <succeeded>/<total> succeeded
Questions answered: <N>/<total>

Key Finding: <one-sentence top finding>
Recommendation: <one-sentence recommendation>
```

### 4.2 Follow-Up Suggestions

Based on the research type and findings, suggest next steps using the skill graph:

| Research Outcome | Suggested Skill | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Research with `scope:` block written | `roadmap extend` | Ingest scope into capability-index + carry-forward registry. Required before sprint. |
| Research complete, roadmap already current | `sprint` | Auto-detects uningested docs, chains roadmap extend if needed, then plans and implements. |
| Architecture decision made, roadmap already current | `sprint-plan` | Plan implementation stories directly. |
| Library selected, ready to integrate | `refactor` | Refactor existing code to use the new library. |
| Feature approach decided | `ui-build` | Build the feature UI. |
| Security concern identified | `codebase-audit` | Audit for related vulnerabilities. |
| Performance approach selected | `test-gen` | Generate performance-related tests. |

---

## Error Recovery

- **No web search available**: Skip `library-docs` and `web-researcher` web searches. Rely on `codebase-analyst` findings and inform the user that research is limited to codebase analysis.
- **Topic too broad**: Ask the user to narrow the scope. Suggest specific sub-topics.
- **No relevant codebase code found**: Note that this is a greenfield investigation. Skip codebase compatibility analysis and focus on stack-level compatibility.
- **Contradictory findings**: Present both sides with evidence. Let the recommendation acknowledge the trade-off.
- **Agent timeout**: Proceed with available findings. Note which agent timed out and what coverage was lost.
