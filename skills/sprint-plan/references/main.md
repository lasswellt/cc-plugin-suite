# Sprint Plan Reference

Supporting schemas, templates, and logic for the sprint-plan skill.

**Companion protocols:**
- [carry-forward-registry.md](/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md) — The append-only JSONL registry. Sprint-plan reads it in Phase 0 for mandatory planning inputs and writes to it in Phase 4.1 when auto-waiving acceptance criteria.

---

## Story File Format

The story-frontmatter contract — schema, producer/consumer matrix, validation algorithm, body sections, and gap-closure template — lives in **[/_shared/story-frontmatter.md](/_shared/story-frontmatter.md)**. Sprint-plan, sprint-dev, and sprint-review all link to that single source.

This section previously duplicated the schema; the duplication caused producer/consumer drift (CAP-133 carry-forward incident traced partly to that duplication). Schema changes go into the shared doc only.

**Sprint-plan-specific responsibilities** when emitting story files:
- Phase 3.2 generates one `S${N}-${SEQ}-<slug>.md` per story under `sprints/sprint-${N}/stories/`.
- The `id:` field MUST equal the filename's `S${N}-${SEQ}` prefix.
- `status:` is always `"planned"` at creation.
- `github_issue:` is `null` until Phase 4.5 (post-issue-creation).
- `registry_entries:` is populated in Phase 4.1 from the auto-waiver / coverage-link logic; never inferred at planning time.
- For `--gaps` mode, set `type: "gap-closure"` and populate `source_finding:` per the shared schema's conditional-required rule.

## Story Partition Logic

Stories are assigned to agent roles based on the primary file types they touch.

### Assignment Rules Table

| File Pattern | Story Focus | Assigned Agent |
|---|---|---|
| `**/schemas/**`, `**/types/**`, `**/models/**` | Type definitions, validation schemas | `backend-dev` |
| `**/api/**`, `**/server/**`, `**/functions/**` | API routes, server handlers, cloud functions | `backend-dev` |
| `**/stores/**`, `**/composables/**`, `**/services/**` | State management, business logic, data services | `backend-dev` |
| `**/components/**`, `**/pages/**`, `**/layouts/**` | UI components, page views, layout templates | `frontend-dev` |
| `**/assets/**`, `**/styles/**`, `**/design-tokens/**` | Design tokens, CSS, static assets | `frontend-dev` |
| `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`, `**/tests/**` | Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests | `test-writer` |
| `**/firebase/**`, `**/infra/**`, `**/.github/**`, `**/ci/**` | Infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD config | `infra-dev` |
| `**/middleware/**`, `**/plugins/**` | Cross-cutting middleware, framework plugins | `backend-dev` |
| `**/config/**`, `**/env/**` | Configuration, environment setup | `infra-dev` |

### Conflict Resolution

When a story touches files matching multiple agents:
1. Assign to the agent whose files are **primary** (most lines changed).
2. If equal, prefer this priority: `backend-dev` > `frontend-dev` > `test-writer` > `infra-dev`.
3. Add a `coordination_note` to the story frontmatter naming the secondary agent.

### Balance Check

After partitioning, verify rough balance:
- No single agent has more than 50% of total story points.
- If imbalanced, consider splitting large stories or reassigning borderline stories.
- Test stories should be ~20-30% of total count (one test story per 2-3 implementation stories).

## Sprint Manifest JSON Schema

The per-sprint manifest lives at `sprints/sprint-${N}/manifest.json` and captures sprint-scoped state that is too volatile for the global `sprint-registry.json`. Sprint-plan writes this file at Phase 1.4; sprint-dev and sprint-review read and update it.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["sprint", "status", "created", "epics", "story_count"],
  "properties": {
    "sprint": { "type": "integer" },
    "status": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["planning", "planned", "in-progress", "review", "reviewed", "done", "cancelled"]
    },
    "created": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "epics": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" },
      "description": "Epic IDs selected for this sprint"
    },
    "carry_forward": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" },
      "description": "Story IDs carried forward from the previous sprint (incomplete stories)"
    },
    "story_count": { "type": "integer" },

    "waived_ac_count": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Number of acceptance criteria auto-waived during Phase 4.1 under autonomy=high|full. Every waiver MUST also append a corresponding line to .cc-sessions/carry-forward.jsonl with event: 'auto_waived' — see skills/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md."
    },
    "reason_waivers": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Short phrase explaining why waivers were applied, e.g., 'autonomy=full'. Populated alongside waived_ac_count."
    },
    "registry_entries_touched": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string" },
      "description": "List of carry-forward registry ids (cf-*) that this sprint's stories advanced. Each entry MUST have been injected as a mandatory planning input OR explicitly claimed by a story in this sprint. Written during Phase 4.1 coverage check; audited in sprint-review Phase 3.6 Invariant 2."
    },
    "mandatory_planning_inputs_source": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Path to sprints/sprint-${N}-planning-inputs.json if the previous sprint-review auto-injected entries into this sprint. Empty when no carry-forward was pending."
    }
  }
}
```

**Waiver accounting:** `waived_ac_count` is the local mirror of what also gets written to the carry-forward registry. Sprint-review Phase 3.5 Invariant 2 cross-checks the two: for every `waived_ac_count > 0`, there MUST be a matching `event: "auto_waived"` line in `.cc-sessions/carry-forward.jsonl` for an entry whose parent epic appears in this manifest's `epics` field. Missing mirror → invariant failure.

## Agent Prompt Templates

<!-- import: /_shared/agent-prompt-boilerplate.md -->
Canonical boilerplate (Generic Agent Preamble, Medium BUDGET, WRITE-AS-YOU-GO) is documented in [/_shared/agent-prompt-boilerplate.md](/_shared/agent-prompt-boilerplate.md). The inline opening block + per-researcher templates below remain the byte-stable spawn source — OUTPUT STYLE inline preservation is required by sprint-review Invariant 5.

**Workload class for all sprint-plan research agents**: Medium (per `skills/_shared/spawn-protocol.md`). Every agent prompt below must open with:

```
You are a general-purpose agent with Write access. Your task is INCOMPLETE
if your output file does not exist when you finish.

BUDGET:
- Max file reads: 15
- Max web searches: 8 (0 for codebase-analyst)
- Max tool calls: 25
- Max output: 250 lines
- Wall-clock: 5 minutes

WRITE-AS-YOU-GO: Stub your output file with `# IN PROGRESS` before your
first research step. After each epic analyzed, append findings to the
file immediately. Do NOT accumulate in memory and write at the end.

OUTPUT STYLE: terse-technical per /_shared/terse-output.md. Drop articles,
fillers, pleasantries, hedging. Preserve verbatim: code fences, inline code,
URLs, file paths, commands, grep patterns, YAML/JSON, headings, table rows,
error codes, dates, version numbers. No preamble. No trailing summary of work
already evident in the diff or tool output. Format: fragments OK.
```

### Domain Researcher

```
You are the domain-researcher for Sprint ${SPRINT_NUMBER} planning.

```

## Error Recovery

- **No epics available**: All epics are blocked or done. Inform user and suggest updating the roadmap. *(If autonomy is `high` or `full`, log to activity feed and exit cleanly — the `/loop` reconciler will detect this state.)*
- **Research agent failure**: Retry once. If still failing, proceed with partial research and flag gaps in summary.
- **Circular dependencies detected**: Report the cycle and ask user to resolve before continuing. *(If autonomy is `high` or `full`, break the cycle by removing the weakest dependency edge — the one with the lowest story priority — log the decision to the activity feed, and proceed.)*
- **GitHub CLI unavailable**: Skip issue creation, note in summary. Stories are still valid without issues.
