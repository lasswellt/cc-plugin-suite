# Sprint Review Skill

Review sprint quality through automated checks and parallel reviewer agents. Run type-check, lint, tests, and build verification. Spawn specialized reviewers for security, backend, frontend, and patterns. Auto-fix common failures. Execute every phase in order. Do NOT skip phases.

---

## Phase 0: CONTEXT — Load Sprint State

0. **Register session.** Follow [session-protocol.md](/_shared/session-protocol.md) §Session Registration (steps 1-9) and [verbose-progress.md](/_shared/verbose-progress.md). Print verbose progress at every phase transition, decision point, and skill-specific dispatch (agent spawn, wave completion, etc.) per verbose-progress.md.
1. **Find the sprint to review.** Read `sprint-registry.json` and find the sprint with `status: review` or `status: in-progress`. If the user specified a sprint number, use that. If no sprint is ready for review, inform the user and STOP.

1b. **Check for STATE.md.** If the sprint has a `STATE.md` checkpoint file, read it for context on blocked stories and their reasons. Include blocked story details in the review report. See [checkpoint-protocol.md](/_shared/checkpoint-protocol.md).

2. **Load incomplete stories.** Read all story files in `${SPRINT_DIR}/stories/`. Categorize:
   - `done` — Implemented, ready for review.
   - `incomplete` — Partially done, flag for attention.
   - `blocked` — Skipped during implementation, note in report.

3. **Build codebase inventory.** Run:
   ```bash
   find . -maxdepth 3 -name 'package.json' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' | head -30
   ```

4. **Detect changed files.** Compare against the sprint's base commit:
   ```bash
   # Find the merge base (commit before sprint started)
   SPRINT_BASE=$(git log --oneline --all | grep -i "sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}" | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f1)
   # If no sprint commit found, use a reasonable default
   git diff --name-only ${SPRINT_BASE}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only HEAD~20..HEAD
   ```

5. **Detect changed packages.** From the changed files, determine which packages/workspaces were modified (see references/main.md for detection rules).

6. **Load registry.** Read `sprint-registry.json` for sprint metadata.

**Gate:** At least one story must have `status: done` and changed files must be detectable.

---

## Phase 1: AUTOMATED CHECKS — Quality Gates

Run all automated checks. Record pass/fail for each. Do NOT stop on first failure — run all checks and collect all results.

### 1.1 Type-Check

```bash
# Detect type-check command from package.json scripts
npm run type-check 2>&1 || npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1
```

Record:
- Pass/Fail
- Error count
- Error list (file, line, message) for auto-fix phase

### 1.2 Lint

```bash
# Detect lint command from package.json scripts
npm run lint 2>&1 || npx eslint . 2>&1
```

Record:
- Pass/Fail
- Warning count, error count
- Error list for auto-fix phase

### 1.3 Unit Tests (Changed Packages Only)

Run tests only for changed packages to save time:

```bash
# For monorepo with workspaces
# Run tests in each changed package
for pkg in ${CHANGED_PACKAGES}; do
  (cd "$pkg" && npm run test 2>&1) || true
done

# For single-package projects
npm run test -- --changed 2>&1 || npm run test 2>&1
```

Record:
- Total tests, passed, failed, skipped
- Failure details (test name, file, assertion message)

### 1.4 Build Verification

```bash
npm run build 2>&1
```

Record:
- Pass/Fail
- Error details if failed

### 1.5 Quality Gate Summary

Write intermediate results to `${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-quality-gates.json`:
```json
{
  "type_check": { "pass": true, "errors": 0, "details": [] },
  "lint": { "pass": false, "errors": 3, "warnings": 12, "details": [] },
  "tests": { "pass": true, "total": 45, "passed": 45, "failed": 0 },
  "build": { "pass": true, "errors": 0 }
}
```

---

## Phase 1.5: PATTERN ANALYSIS — Anti-Mock Scan and Convention Check

### 1.5.1 Anti-Mock Scan

Scan all changed files for placeholder/mock code:
```bash
git diff --name-only ${SPRINT_BASE}..HEAD | xargs grep -n -E \
  '(TODO|FIXME|PLACEHOLDER|STUB|Not implemented|throw new Error.*implement|return \{\}|return \[\])' 2>/dev/null
```

Any matches are **Critical findings** — code is not production-ready. Record each match with file, line, and pattern.

### 1.5.2 Convention Compliance

Check changed files against project conventions:
- **Backend files**: Have auth/validation patterns? Use project's error format?
- **Frontend files**: Handle loading, empty, and error states (three-state pattern)?
- **Store actions**: Call real APIs (not returning hardcoded data)?
- **Test files**: Assert meaningfully (not just `toBeDefined()` or `expect(true).toBe(true)`)?

### 1.5.3 Architectural Compliance

Check for improper cross-layer imports:
- Frontend files should not import directly from server/functions directories
- Backend files should not import Vue components
- Test files should not import from other test files' internals

### 1.5.4 Completeness Check

- Verify all files listed in done stories actually exist
- Check for silently dropped circuit-breaker stories (stories that were blocked but not documented)

### 1.6 Integration Check (Conditional)

If the sprint introduced new modules, routes, stores, or API endpoints, run integration-check to validate cross-module wiring:

```bash
# Detect if sprint introduced new modules
NEW_MODULES=$(git diff --name-only ${SPRINT_BASE}..HEAD | grep -E 'stores/|composables/|pages/|server/api/' | head -20)
if [ -n "$NEW_MODULES" ]; then
  echo "New modules detected — running integration check"
fi
```

If new modules are detected, invoke `/blitz:integration-check all` and map findings to review severity levels:
- Integration-check **high** → Review **Major**
- Integration-check **medium** → Review **Minor**
- Integration-check **low** → Review **Info**

Include integration-check findings in the Phase 2 review context so reviewer agents are aware of wiring gaps.

---

## Phase 2: CODE REVIEW — Parallel Reviewer Agents

### 2.1 Prepare Review Context

Collect the diff for reviewers:
```bash
git diff ${SPRINT_BASE}..HEAD > ${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-full-diff.patch
```

Also list all new and modified files with their sizes for assignment:
```bash
git diff --stat ${SPRINT_BASE}..HEAD
```

### 2.2 Spawn Reviewer Agents via Agent Tool

Spawn 3-4 specialized reviewers using the `Agent` tool, all in **a single assistant message** so they run concurrently. Each writes findings to session-scoped temp files.

Per-spawn parameters:
- `subagent_type: general-purpose` (reviewers must Write; `Explore` cannot)
- `model: sonnet` (explicit — prevents `[1m]` inheritance from Opus orchestrator)
- `description: sprint-<N> <reviewer-role>`
- `prompt`: reviewer prompt from references/main.md with diff slice, story ACs, and Phase 1 gate results
- `run_in_background: true`

**Weight class**: Medium (per [spawn-protocol.md](/_shared/spawn-protocol.md)). Each reviewer prompt MUST include:
- Diff slice bounded by domain (max 500 lines of diff per reviewer — slice the full diff by changed-file path prefix)
- Max 15 file reads per reviewer
- Max 25 tool calls per reviewer
- Max 300-line output
- 5-minute wall-clock budget
- Write-as-you-go: "Append each finding to your output file immediately after identifying it"

| Agent Name | Focus | Output File |
|---|---|---|
| `security-reviewer` | Auth, input validation, secrets, injection, XSS, CSRF | `${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${N}-review-security.md` |
| `backend-reviewer` | API design, error handling, data validation, performance | `${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${N}-review-backend.md` |
| `frontend-reviewer` | Component design, accessibility, UX, responsive, state mgmt | `${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${N}-review-frontend.md` |
| `pattern-reviewer` | Code consistency, naming, DRY, architecture, test coverage | `${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${N}-review-patterns.md` |

### 2.4 Reviewer Instructions

Each reviewer receives:
1. The full diff or relevant subset of changed files.
2. The list of story acceptance criteria for context.
3. Quality gate results from Phase 1.
4. Their specific review checklist (see references/main.md).

### 2.5 Cross-Cutting Findings — Synthesized by Orchestrator

Reviewers write findings to their individual output files. The orchestrator synthesizes cross-cutting findings during Phase 3 report assembly by reading all reviewer files and cross-referencing:

- Security findings with `unvalidated input` tags are propagated into the Backend Review section of the final report.
- Pattern findings about component structure are propagated into the Frontend Review section.
- Backend findings about error handling gaps are propagated into the Frontend Review section.

The previous peer-to-peer `SendMessage CROSS-FINDING:` protocol was removed in v1.4.0 because it had no ack mechanism and findings could be silently truncated when the receiving reviewer was near its output budget. Synthesis-by-orchestrator is structurally safer.

### 2.6 Collect Review Findings

Wait for all reviewers to complete. **Run the canonical Agent Output Contract validator** from [spawn-protocol.md](/_shared/spawn-protocol.md) §8 — it classifies SUCCESS / PARTIAL / MALFORMED / EMPTY / MISSING / TIMEOUT and applies the N=4 standard gate (ABORT at MISSING_COUNT ≥ 2). Do NOT redefine thresholds inline.

```bash
EXPECTED_OUTPUTS=(
  "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-review-security.md"
  "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-review-backend.md"
  "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-review-frontend.md"
  "${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-review-patterns.md"
)
# Run validator from /_shared/spawn-protocol.md §8.
# A security-domain MISSING is particularly dangerous — if classify_output → MISSING for the
# security reviewer specifically, escalate the abort message: "SECURITY DOMAIN UNREVIEWED — sprint cannot close."
```

If all classifications resolve to SUCCESS (post any narrow retries per §8 PARTIAL retry policy), proceed. Carry forward `PARTIAL` annotations into the report's "Review Coverage Gaps" section.

If all files are present and non-empty: read their output files. Merge cross-findings (deduplicate by file+line).

Categorize all findings:
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, auth bypasses. MUST fix before merge.
- **Major**: Broken functionality, missing error handling, accessibility violations. Should fix.
- **Minor**: Code style, naming, minor performance. Fix if time permits.
- **Info**: Suggestions, alternative approaches, future improvements. Document only.

---

## Phase 2.5: BROWSER VERIFICATION (Best-Effort)

If Playwright MCP is available and a dev server can start:

### 2.5.1 Identify Changed Routes

From changed page files, determine which routes were added or modified.

### 2.5.2 Smoke Test

Navigate to each changed route. For each page:
- Check for console errors (Critical or Error severity)
- Check for placeholder/sample data visible on screen (Warning)
- Check for broken layouts or missing content (Warning)

### 2.5.3 Integrate Findings

Add browser findings to the review report:
- Console errors → Error or Critical severity
- Placeholder data visible → Warning severity
- Visual issues → Minor severity

Skip gracefully if Playwright is unavailable — document as a gap in the report, not a failure.

---

## Phase 3: AUTO-FIX — Resolve Common Failures

### 3.1 Auto-Fix Scope

Auto-fix ONLY these categories. **Never auto-fix security issues** — those require human review.

| Category | Auto-Fix Strategy | Max Attempts |
|---|---|---|
| Type errors | Add missing types, fix type mismatches, add null checks | 3 |
| Lint errors | Apply lint auto-fix, then manual fixes for remaining | 3 |
| Missing exports | Add exports to barrel files (index.ts) | 3 |
| Import errors | Fix import paths, add missing imports | 3 |
| Naming inconsistencies | Rename to match project conventions | 2 |
| Missing return types | Add explicit return types to functions | 2 |
| Unused imports | Remove unused imports | 1 |
| Unused variables | Prefix with underscore or remove if safe | 1 |

### 3.2 Auto-Fix Loop

For each fixable issue:

```
attempt = 0
while issue not resolved AND attempt < max_attempts:
    attempt += 1
    apply fix
    run relevant check (type-check, lint, or test)
    if check passes:
        commit: "fix(sprint-${N}/review): auto-fix <category> in <file>"
        mark resolved
    else:
        revert fix if it made things worse
        try alternative fix strategy
```

### 3.3 Fix Ordering

Fix in this order (earlier fixes often resolve later issues):
1. Missing imports and exports (resolves most type errors downstream).
2. Type errors (resolves downstream lint and test errors).
3. Lint errors (auto-fix first, then manual).
4. Naming inconsistencies.
5. Unused imports/variables (cosmetic, last).

### 3.4 Auto-Fix Boundaries

**DO NOT auto-fix:**
- Security findings (XSS, injection, auth bypass, secrets exposure).
- Logic errors (wrong business logic, incorrect calculations).
- Architecture issues (wrong abstraction, missing separation of concerns).
- Test assertion failures (the test might be correct and the code wrong).
- Performance issues (require design decisions).

These are documented in the report for human review.

### 3.5 Post-Fix Verification

After all auto-fixes, re-run the full quality gate suite from Phase 1:
```bash
npm run type-check 2>&1
npm run lint 2>&1
npm run test 2>&1
npm run build 2>&1
```

Record improvement:
```
Before auto-fix: type-errors=12, lint-errors=8, test-failures=2
After auto-fix:  type-errors=0,  lint-errors=1,  test-failures=2
```

## Phase 3.6: REGISTRY INVARIANTS — Carry-Forward Hard Gate

This phase is a **hard gate**: failing any invariant fails the sprint close. Its purpose is to make silent scope drops impossible by auditing the carry-forward registry against the current sprint's state.

Full invariant procedures (Invariants 1-4, the hard-gate decision, report schema, and escalation rules) are in `references/main.md` section **"Registry Invariants — Phase 3.6 Detailed Procedures"**. See also [carry-forward-registry.md](/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md) and `docs/_research/2026-04-08_sprint-carryforward-registry.md`.

**Outline**:
1. Run the canonical Reader Algorithm from [/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md](/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md) §Reader Algorithm with `MODE=review`. The algorithm consolidates Invariants 1, 2, 4 + rollover-ceiling escalation into one executable script — exit 2 = INVARIANT FAILURE; exit 3 = ESCALATION; both block sprint close.
2. Run skill-local Invariants 3 and 5 (not yet in the canonical algorithm):
   - **Invariant 3**: every epic claiming `status: done|complete` has all its registry entries at `status: complete`.
   - **Invariant 5**: every SKILL.md under `skills/*/SKILL.md` AND every `skills/*/references/main.md` containing an Agent-prompt template contains the canonical `OUTPUT STYLE: … per /_shared/terse-output.md` snippet from `spawn-protocol.md` §7. Missing snippet → Critical finding → sprint FAILs (BLOCKER).
3. Write the Invariants Report section to the review report.
4. **Hard gate**: Reader Algorithm exit 0 + Invariants 3, 5 pass → proceed to Phase 4. Any fail → `CONDITIONAL` at best; ESCALATION (exit 3) or Invariant 5 fail → FAIL.

### Invariant 5 — Agent-Prompt Output Style Snippet (BLOCKER)

Pair enforcement for `spawn-protocol.md` §7. The canonical snippet:

```
OUTPUT STYLE: <intensity> per /_shared/terse-output.md. Drop articles,
fillers, pleasantries, hedging. Preserve verbatim: code fences, inline code,
URLs, file paths, commands, grep patterns, YAML/JSON, headings, table rows,
error codes, dates, version numbers. No preamble. No trailing summary of work
already evident in the diff or tool output. Format: fragments OK.
```

MUST appear in every `skills/*/references/main.md` that contains an agent-prompt template (7 files as of Sprint 3: codebase-audit, codebase-map, code-sweep, integration-check, quality-metrics, sprint-dev, sprint-plan). Any missing snippet is a Critical finding; sprint status transitions to **FAIL**.

Audit command (sprint-review runs this in Phase 3.6 — covers SKILL.md AND references/main.md):

```bash
SNIPPET_RE='OUTPUT STYLE: (terse-technical|lite|full|ultra) per /_shared/terse-output.md'

# Every SKILL.md must include the snippet (Anthropic-canonical SKILL.md template requirement).
SKILL_TOTAL=$(ls skills/*/SKILL.md | wc -l)
SKILL_PRESENT=$(grep -lE "$SNIPPET_RE" skills/*/SKILL.md | wc -l)
[ "$SKILL_PRESENT" -eq "$SKILL_TOTAL" ] \
  || echo "Invariant 5 FAIL (SKILL.md): $SKILL_PRESENT / $SKILL_TOTAL contain canonical OUTPUT STYLE snippet"

# Every references/main.md that contains an Agent-prompt template must include the snippet.
REF_WITH_PROMPTS=$(grep -l "Agent Prompt Template\|prompt:" skills/*/references/main.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
REF_PRESENT=$(grep -lE "$SNIPPET_RE" skills/*/references/main.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
[ "$REF_PRESENT" -ge "$REF_WITH_PROMPTS" ] \
  || echo "Invariant 5 FAIL (references/main.md): $REF_PRESENT / $REF_WITH_PROMPTS contain canonical OUTPUT STYLE snippet"
```

The check is total-coverage on SKILL.md (no exemptions) and present-where-needed on references/main.md (only files with embedded agent prompts). Adding a new SKILL.md without the snippet auto-fails the next review.

---

## Phase 4: REPORT — Write Review Report and Update Registry

### 4.1 Write Review Report

**Output style:** terse-technical per [/_shared/terse-output.md](/_shared/terse-output.md). Tables preferred over prose. Executive Summary: 2-3 fragments. Recommendations: imperative bullets. Preserve verbatim: quality-gate table structure, severity prefixes, file paths, grep patterns, JSON invariant records. **LITE intensity** (full sentences, reasoning-chain preserved) for: critical/major findings explanations, security/CVE details, root-cause sections, registry-invariant mismatch deltas. `full` intensity for info-level and cosmetic findings. Finding format: `L<line>: <severity-prefix> <problem>. <fix>.` with 🔴/🟡/🔵/❓ prefixes (see S3-003 review-format absorption). If no findings in a severity bucket, write `LGTM` and stop — do not pad.

Write `${SPRINT_DIR}/review-report.md` using the template from references/main.md. Include:

1. **Executive Summary** — Sprint number, date, overall status (PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL).
2. **Quality Gates** — Pass/fail table for all automated checks (before and after auto-fix).
3. **Review Findings** — All findings from reviewer agents, grouped by severity.
4. **Auto-Fix Summary** — What was fixed, what remains, what was skipped.
5. **Story Status** — Table of all stories with final status.
6. **Recommendations** — Prioritized list of manual fixes needed before merge.

### 4.2 Determine Overall Status

| Status | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **PASS** | All quality gates pass. No critical or major findings. **All four Phase 3.6 registry invariants pass.** |
| **CONDITIONAL** | Quality gates pass but major findings exist. Or: minor gate failures with no critical findings. Or: **any Phase 3.6 registry invariant fails** — the sprint cannot reach PASS while carry-forward state is inconsistent. |
| **FAIL** | Any quality gate fails after auto-fix. Or: critical findings exist. Or: **a Phase 3.6 invariant failure escalates to `rollover_count >= 3`** on any entry and the operator has not resolved it. |

### 4.3 Update Sprint Registry

**Registry Lock — `sprint-registry.json`**: Before writing, acquire a file-based lock per [session-protocol.md](/_shared/session-protocol.md):
1. CHECK if `sprint-registry.json.lock` exists — if stale (session completed/failed or >4h old with dead PID), delete it.
2. ACQUIRE by writing `sprint-registry.json.lock` with `{ "session_id": "${SESSION_ID}", "acquired": "<ISO-8601>" }`.
3. VERIFY by re-reading the lock file — confirm it contains YOUR `SESSION_ID`. If not, wait up to 60s (check every 5s), then ABORT with conflict report.
4. OPERATE — read, modify, and write the registry file.
5. RELEASE — delete `sprint-registry.json.lock` and append `lock_released` to the operation log.

Update `sprint-registry.json`:
```json
{
  "number": <N>,
  "status": "reviewed",
  "review_date": "<ISO-8601>",
  "review_status": "PASS|CONDITIONAL|FAIL",
  "quality_gates": {
    "type_check": true,
    "lint": true,
    "tests": true,
    "build": true
  },
  "findings": {
    "critical": 0,
    "major": 2,
    "minor": 5,
    "info": 8
  },
  "auto_fixes_applied": 7,
  "stories_reviewed": 12,
  "stories_done": 10,
  "stories_incomplete": 1,
  "stories_blocked": 1
}
```

### 4.4 Shutdown Review Team

Send completion message to all reviewer agents and shutdown the team.

### 4.5 Git Commit

```bash
git add ${SPRINT_DIR}/review-report.md
git add sprint-registry.json
git commit -m "review(sprint-${N}): ${STATUS} — ${FINDINGS_CRITICAL}c/${FINDINGS_MAJOR}M/${FINDINGS_MINOR}m findings, ${AUTO_FIXES} auto-fixes"
```

### 4.5.5 Record Quality Metrics

After the review commit, collect a quality metrics snapshot for trend tracking:
```
Invoke: /blitz:quality-metrics collect
```
This stores a timestamped JSON snapshot in `docs/metrics/` that can be used for trend analysis across sprints. The metrics are informational and do not gate the review.

### 4.6 Final Output and Error Recovery

Print the summary block and apply recovery rules from `references/main.md` sections **"Final Output Template"** and **"Error Recovery"**.
- **No test runner found**: Skip test gate, mark as "SKIPPED" (not "FAIL") in report.
