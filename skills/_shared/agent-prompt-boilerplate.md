# Agent Prompt Boilerplate — Shared Fragment

Canonical text for prompt sections that recur across blitz orchestrator skills (codebase-audit, codebase-map, code-sweep, integration-check, quality-metrics, sprint-dev, sprint-plan).

**Purpose:** author-time deduplication of the ~12 K tokens/sprint of recurring Agent() prompt boilerplate. Skills currently inline these sections in their own `references/main.md` for byte-stable spawn behavior. Future orchestrators may Read this fragment plus the per-skill `references/main.md` and splice the relevant section into the Agent() prompt at spawn time, replacing the inline copy. Until that splice machinery exists in every orchestrator, the inline copies in `skills/<skill>/reference.md` remain authoritative; this fragment is the canonical reference + extraction target.

**Important:** the `OUTPUT STYLE: terse-technical …` snippet is NOT extracted here. Sprint-review Invariant 5 (per S5-003) requires that snippet to be present verbatim in every references/main.md — deduping it would break the invariant. The canonical OUTPUT STYLE text lives in [spawn-protocol.md §7](spawn-protocol.md#7-output-style-terse-output-protocol).

**Companion docs:**
- [spawn-protocol.md](spawn-protocol.md) — weight classes (Light/Medium/Heavy), HEARTBEAT/PARTIAL canonical specs, banned patterns
- [terse-output.md](terse-output.md) — the OUTPUT STYLE protocol referenced by every Agent() prompt
- [verbose-progress.md](verbose-progress.md) — activity-feed log format

## Generic Agent Preamble

Used by orchestrators that spawn `general-purpose` Agents and require a written output file. Present in: `codebase-map`, `integration-check`, `quality-metrics`, `sprint-plan`.

```
You are a general-purpose agent with Write access. Your task is INCOMPLETE
if {{OUTPUT_PATH}} does not exist when you finish.
```

**When to use:** any Agent() spawn whose deliverable is a file the orchestrator will Read after the agent returns. Combine with the orchestrator-side existence check (see `spawn-protocol.md` §2 "Orchestrator-Side Validation"). Replace `{{OUTPUT_PATH}}` with the absolute path the agent must write.

---

## Weight-Class Budget Block

Every Medium/Heavy Agent() spawn declares its budget in the prompt. Caps per `spawn-protocol.md` §2.

### Medium class

Used by: `codebase-map` (per-dimension agents), `integration-check` (per-domain agents), `sprint-plan` (research agents).

```
BUDGET (Medium class — see skills/_shared/spawn-protocol.md):
- Max file reads: 15
- Max web searches: 8 (0 for codebase-only analysis)
- Max tool calls: 25
- Max output: 250 lines
- Wall-clock: 5 minutes
```

### Light class

Used by: `quality-metrics` (per-tool collectors).

```
BUDGET (Light class — see skills/_shared/spawn-protocol.md):
- Max bash commands: 1 (the tool invocation itself)
- Max file reads: 5
- Max tool calls: 8
- Max output: JSON (per per-tool schema)
- Wall-clock: 3 minutes
```

### Heavy class

Used by: `sprint-dev` dev agents (multi-story implementation in worktree).

```
BUDGET:
- Max stories this wave: 4 (already enforced by orchestrator)
- Max file reads per story: 6
- Max tool calls total: 40 (if you hit 30, finish current story and stop)
- Wall-clock: 8 min
```

**When to use:** include the matching block verbatim near the top of every Medium/Heavy Agent() prompt. Override caps with documented rationale only — defaults exist to bound silent-failure cost.

---

## Write-As-You-Go Preamble

Mandatory for Medium and Heavy agents. Prevents zero-output failure on timeout or turn-budget exhaustion. Present in: `codebase-map`, `integration-check`, `quality-metrics` (implied by JSON-stub start), `sprint-plan`.

```
WRITE-AS-YOU-GO (MANDATORY):
1. Before your first tool call, stub the output file with a header line.
2. After each checklist item / phase / finding, append to the file.
3. Do NOT accumulate findings in memory and write at the end.
```

**Variant for JSON outputs** (used by `code-sweep` tier agents and `integration-check`):

```
WRITE-AS-YOU-GO (MANDATORY):
1. Before your first tool call, stub the output file with an empty findings array.
2. After each check category completes, rewrite the file with the appended findings array.
```

**When to use:** every Medium/Heavy spawn whose output is a file. The orchestrator should still run the existence check from `spawn-protocol.md` §2 — write-as-you-go is the agent-side complement.

---

## HEARTBEAT Protocol

Mid-run liveness signal. Canonical spec in [spawn-protocol.md §3](spawn-protocol.md#3-heartbeat-and-partial-protocols). Present in: `codebase-map`, `integration-check` (JSON variant), `sprint-dev` (Item 12).

### File-append form (default)

```
HEARTBEAT PROTOCOL:
At the start of each phase, append this line to your output file:
  HEARTBEAT: <phase-name> at <ISO-8601-timestamp>
Use at least 3 heartbeats across your task. Use Bash `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`
to produce the timestamp.
```

### JSON-finding variant (for agents whose output is a JSON array)

```
HEARTBEAT (recommended):
At the start of each check category, append this line to your output file
as a special finding with `"check": "_heartbeat"`:
  {"check": "_heartbeat", "phase": "<category>", "ts": "<ISO-timestamp>"}
Use Bash `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` for timestamp.
```

### Story-completion variant (sprint-dev dev agents)

```
HEARTBEAT: After each story DONE, write a file ${SESSION_TMP_DIR}/agent-<role>-progress.md
appending: HEARTBEAT: S${N}-XXX done at <ISO-timestamp>. Use date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ.
```

**When to use:** required for Heavy agents; recommended for Medium. Pick the variant matching your output schema.

---

## PARTIAL Transcript Protocol

Graceful degradation on budget exhaustion. Canonical spec in [spawn-protocol.md §3](spawn-protocol.md#3-heartbeat-and-partial-protocols). Required for Heavy class. Present in: `sprint-dev` (Item 12).

### Heavy-class canonical form

```
PARTIAL DEGRADATION:
If you have 3 or fewer tool calls remaining (or detect approaching the turn
limit, output-token limit, or wall-clock budget), STOP and append this block
to the output file:
  ---
  PARTIAL: true
  COMPLETED: [list of sections finished]
  MISSING: [list of sections skipped]
  CONFIDENCE: low|medium|high
  ---
Then write a one-line confirmation to the caller: "PARTIAL: <N> sections
complete, <M> missing" and end.
```

### Sprint-dev variant (story-id granularity)

```
PARTIAL: If you have fewer than 3 tool calls remaining, STOP before starting
a new story. Append to your progress file:
  PARTIAL: true
  COMPLETED: [list of story ids finished]
  REMAINING: [list of story ids unstarted]
  CONFIDENCE: low|medium|high
Send PARTIAL: <N> done, <M> remaining to orchestrator via the DONE/BLOCKED
protocol and end.
```

**When to use:** mandatory for Heavy agents; orchestrator must check for `PARTIAL: true` before consuming output and re-spawn narrowly on items in MISSING/REMAINING.

---

## Confirmation Line

Used by Medium agents to signal completion to the orchestrator without echoing findings. Present in: `codebase-map`, `integration-check`, `quality-metrics`, `code-sweep` (tier agents).

```
CONFIRMATION: Emit one line: "<scope-id>: <N items written>"
Do NOT echo findings in your response.
```

**When to use:** any agent whose output is a file the orchestrator will read. Prevents stdout from re-transmitting payload that the file already contains (saves tokens, keeps logs clean).

---

## Output-Style Reference (NOT extracted — invariant)

The canonical OUTPUT STYLE snippet that closes every Agent() prompt template lives in [spawn-protocol.md §7](spawn-protocol.md#7-output-style-terse-output-protocol). It is **deliberately not extracted into this fragment.** Sprint-review Invariant 5 enforces verbatim presence of that snippet in every `skills/*/reference.md` agent-prompt template. Deduping it would break the invariant. Each references/main.md must continue to carry the snippet inline.

For the resolved active-intensity behavior at spawn time, see `spawn-protocol.md` §7 "Active-intensity interpolation".

## How Orchestrators Use This Fragment

Two integration patterns:

### Pattern A — author-time reference only (current default)

Skills inline the relevant boilerplate sections in their own `references/main.md`. This fragment serves as the canonical source for what the inline text should say. When updating a recurring section, edit here first, then propagate to the affected references/main.md files. The orchestrator does NOT Read this fragment at spawn time.

### Pattern B — runtime splice (future)

The orchestrator Reads both `skills/<skill>/reference.md` and `skills/_shared/agent-prompt-boilerplate.md` at spawn time, then splices the relevant section into the Agent() prompt where the import marker appears in references/main.md. Once every orchestrator that spawns from a given references/main.md has migrated to Pattern B, the inline copy in that references/main.md may be removed.

**Migration safety:** Pattern B requires byte-identical resolved-prompt parity (see S5-001 AC3). Until parity is verified for a specific orchestrator+skill pair, the inline copy must remain — Invariant 5 (OUTPUT STYLE) and exact-match TASKS lists in agent prompts depend on per-byte stability.

## Per-Skill Section Index

| references/main.md | Sections currently inlined (mirror these from this fragment when updating) |
|---|---|
| `codebase-audit/reference.md` | OUTPUT STYLE only — no HEARTBEAT/PARTIAL/BUDGET (audit pillars use their own pillar-checklist budget) |
| `codebase-map/reference.md` | Generic agent preamble · Medium BUDGET · WRITE-AS-YOU-GO · HEARTBEAT (file-append) · CONFIRMATION |
| `code-sweep/reference.md` | OUTPUT STYLE only — tier agents have a 90-second budget inline; JSON write-as-you-go implicit in single-array Write |
| `integration-check/reference.md` | Generic agent preamble · Medium BUDGET · WRITE-AS-YOU-GO (JSON variant) · HEARTBEAT (JSON variant) · CONFIRMATION |
| `quality-metrics/reference.md` | Generic agent preamble · Light BUDGET · WRITE-AS-YOU-GO (implicit) · CONFIRMATION |
| `sprint-dev/reference.md` | Heavy BUDGET (Item 3) · HEARTBEAT (story-completion variant) + PARTIAL (sprint-dev variant) (Item 12) |
| `sprint-plan/reference.md` | Generic agent preamble · Medium BUDGET · WRITE-AS-YOU-GO |

When extending boilerplate or fixing a bug in a recurring section, update this fragment first, then propagate to the affected references/main.md files.
