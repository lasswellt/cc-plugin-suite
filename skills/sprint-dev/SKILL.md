# Sprint Development Skill

Implement a planned sprint by spawning coordinated agent teams in isolated worktrees, distributing stories as tasks with dependency ordering, and monitoring progress through completion. Execute every phase in order. Do NOT skip phases.

## Execution Mode

Read autonomy from `.cc-sessions/developer-profile.json` per [session-protocol.md](/_shared/session-protocol.md) §Autonomy Levels (default: `medium`). Map autonomy to `--mode` per the table below; an explicit `--mode` flag overrides only when autonomy is `low` or `medium`. **At autonomy `high` or `full`, force `autonomous` regardless of any `--mode` flag** — loop mode with bypass permissions cannot pause for confirmations.

| Autonomy (canonical) | Default mode | User `--mode` honored? |
|---|---|---|
| `low` | `interactive` | Yes |
| `medium` | `checkpoint` | Yes |
| `high` | `autonomous` | No (always autonomous) |
| `full` | `autonomous` | No (always autonomous) |

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `autonomous` | Orchestrator manages everything. No pauses except for errors. |
| `checkpoint` | Pause after each wave completion. Present wave results to user, ask for confirmation before starting next wave. |
| `interactive` | Present each story to the user before assigning it to an agent. Ask for approach confirmation. Pair-programming style. |

---

## Phase 0.0: INPUT GATE — Validate Pipeline Inputs

Before any other work, hard-fail if required upstream artifacts are missing. Per [state-handoff.md](/_shared/state-handoff.md):

```bash
PIPELINE_MISSING=()
[ -s "sprint-registry.json" ] || PIPELINE_MISSING+=("sprint-registry.json")
SPRINT_NUMBER="${SPRINT_NUMBER:-$(jq -r '.current_sprint // empty' sprint-registry.json 2>/dev/null)}"
SPRINT_DIR="sprints/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}"
[ -s "${SPRINT_DIR}/manifest.json" ] || PIPELINE_MISSING+=("${SPRINT_DIR}/manifest.json")
ls "${SPRINT_DIR}/stories/"S*.md >/dev/null 2>&1 || PIPELINE_MISSING+=("${SPRINT_DIR}/stories/S*.md")
if [ "${#PIPELINE_MISSING[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "BLOCK: missing pipeline inputs (see /_shared/state-handoff.md §sprint-dev):" >&2
  printf '  - %s\n' "${PIPELINE_MISSING[@]}" >&2
  echo "Producer: /blitz:sprint-plan." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Then validate every story file against [story-frontmatter.md](/_shared/story-frontmatter.md) §Validation algorithm. Report ALL validation failures together, do not abort on the first.

## Phase 0: CONTEXT — Load Project State

0. **Register session.** Follow [session-protocol.md](/_shared/session-protocol.md) §Session Registration (steps 1-9) and [verbose-progress.md](/_shared/verbose-progress.md). Print verbose progress at every phase transition, decision point, and skill-specific dispatch (agent spawn, wave completion, etc.) per verbose-progress.md.
1. **Check for checkpoint (STATE.md).** Before anything else, check if the target sprint has a `STATE.md` file:
   ```bash
   SPRINT_DIR="sprints/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}"
   cat "${SPRINT_DIR}/STATE.md" 2>/dev/null | head -5
   ```
   If STATE.md exists, follow the **resume flow** from [checkpoint-protocol.md](/_shared/checkpoint-protocol.md):
   - Validate staleness (>24h = warn user, ask whether to resume or start fresh). **If autonomy is `high` or `full` (e.g., loop mode), skip the staleness prompt and auto-resume regardless of age.** Log a `decision` event noting the auto-resume.
   - Validate worktrees (`git worktree list`).
   - Rebuild `agent_tracker` from STATE.md tables.
   - Skip to Phase 3 with remaining stories.
   - Log a `decision` event: "Resuming sprint ${N} from checkpoint".

   If STATE.md does not exist, continue with normal flow.

1b. **Check for incomplete sprints.** Search for `sprint-registry.json` and check for sprints with `status: in-progress`. If one exists, resume it (skip to Phase 1 with that sprint). Warn the user. *(If autonomy is `high` or `full`, log the warning and auto-resume without prompting.)*
2. **Build codebase inventory.** Run:
   ```bash
   find . -maxdepth 3 -name 'package.json' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' | head -30
   ```
   Read root `package.json` and workspace config to understand structure.
3. **Verify build health.** Run a type-check and build to establish baseline:
   ```bash
   # Detect and run appropriate commands
   npm run type-check 2>&1 | tail -20  # or equivalent
   npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20       # or equivalent
   ```
   Record baseline error count. If baseline has errors, note them as pre-existing.
4. **Load detected stack.** Note framework, package manager, test runner, and build system from the stack profile above.

**Gate:** Build must succeed (or pre-existing errors must be cataloged) before spawning agents.

---

## Phase 0.5: DISCOVER — Learn Project Conventions

Before any agent writes code, build a conventions guide. Read 2-3 representative files from each layer (backend, stores, pages/components, tests) and document: auth pattern, error format, response envelope, validation approach, component style, CSS approach, store pattern, loading UI, test structure, file naming. Then identify reusable assets:

```bash
find . -path '*/composables/*' -o -path '*/utils/*' -o -path '*/shared/*' -o -path '*/components/base/*' | grep -v node_modules | head -30
```

Produce a **REUSE THESE — do not recreate** list with file paths and what each provides. Full checklist and conventions-guide schema in `references/main.md` section **"Project Conventions Discovery"**.

**Gate:** Conventions guide must be complete before spawning agents.

---

## Phase 1: LOAD SPRINT — Find and Parse Planned Sprint

### 1.1 Find Latest Planned Sprint

Read `sprint-registry.json` and find the sprint with `status: planned`. If the user specified a sprint number, use that instead.

```bash
# Find sprint directory
SPRINT_DIR="sprints/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}"
```

### 1.2 Load Sprint Manifest

Read `${SPRINT_DIR}/manifest.json` to get epic list and story count.

### 1.3 Load All Stories

Read every story file in `${SPRINT_DIR}/stories/`. For each story, extract:
- `id`, `title`, `assigned_agent`, `depends_on`, `priority`, `points`, `files`

### 1.4 Build Dependency Graph and Compute Waves

Construct a DAG from story `depends_on` fields. Then compute execution waves:

1. **Wave 0**: All stories with no dependencies (can start immediately).
2. **Wave N**: All stories whose dependencies are ALL in Waves 0..N-1.
3. **Critical path**: Longest dependency chain (determines minimum wave count).

Print the wave execution plan:
```
[sprint-dev] Wave Execution Plan:
  Wave 0 (parallel): S${N}-001, S${N}-002, S${N}-008 (schemas + types)
  Wave 1 (parallel): S${N}-003, S${N}-004 (backend logic, depends on Wave 0)
  Wave 2 (parallel): S${N}-005, S${N}-007 (frontend + tests, depends on Wave 1)
  Critical path: S${N}-001 → S${N}-004 → S${N}-005 (3 waves minimum)
```

Also identify:
- **Ready stories**: Wave 0 stories (can start immediately).
- **Blocked stories**: Stories in Wave 1+ (have dependencies that are not yet complete).

### 1.5 Load Carry-Forward Items

If the manifest has `carry_forward` entries, load those stories and add them to the graph.

### 1.6 Update Sprint Status

**Registry Lock — `sprint-registry.json`**: Before writing, acquire a file-based lock per [session-protocol.md](/_shared/session-protocol.md):
1. CHECK if `sprint-registry.json.lock` exists — if stale (session completed/failed or >4h old with dead PID), delete it.
2. ACQUIRE by writing `sprint-registry.json.lock` with `{ "session_id": "${SESSION_ID}", "acquired": "<ISO-8601>" }`.
3. VERIFY by re-reading the lock file — confirm it contains YOUR `SESSION_ID`. If not, wait up to 60s (check every 5s), then ABORT with conflict report.
4. OPERATE — read, modify, and write the registry file.
5. RELEASE — delete `sprint-registry.json.lock` and append `lock_released` to the operation log.

Update `sprint-registry.json`: set sprint status to `in-progress`, record `started_date`.

---

## Phase 2: CREATE TEAM AND TASKS — Spawn Agents with Worktree Isolation

### 2.1 Create Development Team

Use `TeamCreate` to create a team named `sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-dev`.

### 2.2 Determine Required Agents

Based on story assignments, spawn only the agents that have stories:

| Agent Name | Role | Worktree Branch | MCP Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backend-dev` | Schemas, APIs, stores, services, cloud functions | `sprint-${N}/backend` | Firestore, Firebase MCP only |
| `frontend-dev` | Components, pages, layouts, navigation, styles | `sprint-${N}/frontend` | Playwright MCP only |
| `test-writer` | Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests | `sprint-${N}/tests` | Read-only tools only |
| `infra-dev` | Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment (if stories exist) | `sprint-${N}/infra` | Full (infra-scoped) |

**Agent MCP scoping:** If the project has `.claude/agents/` definitions for `blitz-backend-dev`, `blitz-frontend-dev`, or `blitz-test-writer`, those definitions are used at spawn time and their `mcpServers` field restricts which MCP servers each agent can access — backend agents only get database/API MCPs, frontend gets Playwright/Figma, test-writer gets none. Check for these files before spawning:
```bash
ls .claude/agents/blitz-{backend,frontend,test}-dev.md 2>/dev/null
```
If missing, agents inherit the full session MCP set (existing behavior, safe fallback).

### 2.3 Spawn Agents with Worktree Isolation

Spawn each agent using the `Agent` tool with `isolation: "worktree"`. This gives each agent an isolated git worktree that is automatically cleaned up if no changes are made.

```
Agent(
  name: "<role>",
  subagent_type: "blitz:<role>",
  team_name: "sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}-dev",
  isolation: "worktree",
  prompt: "<agent instructions — see below>"
)
```

**Note:** The `isolation: "worktree"` parameter replaces manual `git worktree add` commands. Each agent gets its own branch and working directory automatically. Worktrees with no changes are auto-cleaned on agent completion; worktrees with changes are preserved for merging.

**Weight class**: Heavy (per [spawn-protocol.md](/_shared/spawn-protocol.md)). Dev agents implement multiple stories with reads+writes+verify per story.

**Per-wave caps (CRITICAL)** — whichever bites first: ≤**4 stories** AND ≤**6 affected files** per agent per wave (sum across stories). A 5-file story + two 1-file siblings = 7 files → split to next wave even with 3-story count. Each file averages 5-7 tool calls; 6 files fits Heavy-class, 8 exhausts mid-work (sprint-276 root cause).

**Agent prompt content** — the full 12-item prompt specification (role, stories, BUDGET block, project conventions, commit format, conventions guide, reusable assets, anti-mock rules, deviation protocol, wave assignment, context management, HEARTBEAT+PARTIAL protocol) is in `references/main.md` section **"Dev Agent Prompt Specification"**. Every spawn must include all 12 items.

### 2.5 Create Tasks with Dependency Ordering

For each story, create a task using `TaskCreate`:
- Title: `S${N}-XXX: <story title>`
- Assigned to: the appropriate agent
- Dependencies: mapped from story `depends_on`
- Status: `pending` (or `ready` if no dependencies)

### 2.6 Send Initial Instructions

Send each agent their first batch of **ready** stories (no unmet dependencies). Include full story content.

### 2.7 Track Agent State

Maintain an in-memory tracker:
```
agent_tracker = {
  "<agent-name>": {
    "agent_id": "<id>",
    "status": "active",      // active | stuck | completed
    "current_story": "S1-003",
    "completed": ["S1-001"],
    "failed_attempts": 0     // circuit breaker counter
  }
}
```

Worktree paths are managed by the Agent tool's `isolation: "worktree"` parameter and do not need manual tracking.

**Circuit breaker:** If an agent fails the same story 3 times, mark the story as `blocked`, notify the orchestrator, and move the agent to the next available story.

---

## Phase 3: IMPLEMENT — Monitor and Coordinate

### 3.1 Agent Work Loop

Each agent follows this loop for each assigned story:

1. **Read story** — Parse frontmatter and body. Note `verify` and `done` fields if present.
2. **Implement** — Create/modify files as specified. Follow implementation notes and code snippets. Follow the [Deviation Handling Protocol](/_shared/deviation-protocol.md) for unexpected issues.
3. **Verify** — Run the story's `verify` commands if defined. If no `verify` field, fall back to type-check:
   ```bash
   # If story has verify commands, run each one:
   cd <worktree> && <verify_command_1> && <verify_command_2> ...
   # Otherwise fall back to generic type-check:
   cd <worktree> && npm run type-check 2>&1
   ```
4. **Check done criteria** — Verify the story's `done` field is satisfied (all stated conditions are met).
5. **Commit** — If verification passes:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "feat(sprint-${N}/<role>): S${N}-XXX <title>"
   ```
6. **Complete** — Update task status to `completed` via `TaskUpdate`.
7. **Next** — Request next story from orchestrator.

### 3.2 Orchestrator Monitoring Loop

The orchestrator (you) must:

1. **Monitor progress** using the Monitor tool (event-driven) in preference to polling. Start a background progress monitor before the first agent wave:
   ```bash
   # Agents append JSON lines to this file on DONE/BLOCKED/HEARTBEAT
   PROGRESS_FILE=".cc-sessions/${SESSION_ID}/tmp/sprint-progress.jsonl"
   touch "$PROGRESS_FILE"
   ```
   Then use the `Monitor` tool:
   ```
   Monitor(
     description: "Sprint ${N} agent progress",
     command: "tail -f ${PROGRESS_FILE} | grep --line-buffered '\"status\":\"done\"\\|\"status\":\"blocked\"\\|\"event\":\"wave_complete\"'",
     persistent: true
   )
   ```
   Each stdout line from the monitor wakes this session as a notification event, eliminating the need for manual polling. Fall back to `TaskList` polling (every 2-3 turns) only if Monitor is unavailable. Track wave-level completion — when all stories in a wave complete, print a wave progress report per [verbose-progress.md](/_shared/verbose-progress.md) and unblock all Wave N+1 stories.
1a. **Write carry-forward registry progress on story `DONE:`.** When an agent signals `DONE:`, before updating STATE.md, follow the writer contract in [/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md](/_shared/carry-forward-registry.md) §Writers (sprint-dev): validate the story's `registry_entries` ids (per [story-frontmatter.md](/_shared/story-frontmatter.md)), compute `new_actual = current + delta` (clamp at `scope.target`), append a `progress` line transitioning to `partial` or `complete`, and log the activity-feed mirror. Apply the inference-fallback (parent-epic link with `delta: 1`) when the story omits `registry_entries`. No-op for stories whose epic also has no registry link.

1b. **Update STATE.md** — After each story completion (or at wave boundaries), update `${SPRINT_DIR}/STATE.md` per [checkpoint-protocol.md](/_shared/checkpoint-protocol.md). This enables session recovery if interrupted. Include wave progress.
1c. **Commit and push at wave boundaries** — `git add -A && git commit -m "feat(sprint-${N}): wave ${WAVE} complete — ${COMPLETED}/${TOTAL} stories" && git push origin HEAD`. Required for `/loop` mode resumability (next tick runs in fresh context). Also push after each integration fix round (Phase 4.3) and at sprint completion (Phase 4.9).
2. **Unblock stories** — When a dependency completes, send newly-ready stories to the appropriate agent.
3. **Coordinate via SendMessage** — When an agent completes a story that another agent depends on:
   ```
   SendMessage to <waiting-agent>:
   UNBLOCK: S${N}-XXX is complete. You can now start S${N}-YYY.
   Files created: <list>. Key exports: <list>.
   ```
4. **Handle stuck agents** — If an agent reports errors or makes no progress:
   - Send a `ASSIST:` message with hints from other agents' completed work.
   - If still stuck after 2 assists, invoke circuit breaker.
5. **Context hygiene** — Follow the [Context Management Protocol](/_shared/context-management.md):
   - Summarize agent completions (files + exports), don't relay full output.
   - Print compact progress at wave boundaries (every wave completion).
   - Offload progress to STATE.md rather than keeping it all in context.
   - If context monitor warns at ~60%+, write checkpoint and summarize.

### 3.3 Cross-Agent Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through the orchestrator using prefixed messages (DONE, BLOCKED, DEVIATION, ESCALATE, UNBLOCK, ASSIST, SYNC, HALT). Full direction/purpose table in `references/main.md` section **"Communication Prefix Table"**. See also [deviation-protocol.md](/_shared/deviation-protocol.md).

### 3.4 Story Distribution Rules

Stories are sent to agents in this priority order:

| Priority | Story Type | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Schema / type definitions | Everything else depends on types |
| 2 | Server functions / API routes | Backend logic before frontend |
| 3 | Stores / state management | Data layer before UI |
| 4 | Components / pages | UI after data layer exists |
| 5 | Navigation / layout integration | After components exist |
| 6 | Tests | After implementation is stable |

Within same priority, higher `priority` field stories go first, then lower `points` (smaller stories first).

---

## Phase 3.5: INTEGRATION CHECKS AND UI/UX PASS (MANDATORY)

This phase is **mandatory** and must not be skipped, even if no explicit UI stories exist.

### 3.5.0 Run Integration Check (Mandatory)

Before the UI/UX pass, run `/blitz:integration-check` to verify cross-module wiring on the just-implemented code:
- Export-to-import tracing (are new exports consumed?)
- Route coverage (do new pages have navigation?)
- Store wiring (are new stores connected to components?)

This step is **mandatory** because integration gaps caught at Phase 3.5.0 cost one fix-round; the same gaps caught at sprint-review Phase 1.6 cost a full review-and-fix-round. If integration-check finds high-severity issues, address them before the UI pass and re-run before proceeding.

### 3.5.1 Spawn Integration Agent

Spawn `blitz:frontend-dev` (reused or fresh as `ui-integrator`) as a Medium-class agent on a dedicated `sprint-${N}/integration` worktree branch. Full spawn parameters, progress-file schema, HEARTBEAT inclusion, and the mandatory-fallback rule when the agent exits mid-checklist are in `references/main.md` section **"Integration Agent Spawn + Fallback"**. See also [spawn-protocol.md](/_shared/spawn-protocol.md).

### 3.5.2 Integration Checklist

The integration agent verifies and implements: **Navigation entries**, **Design tokens**, **Layout consistency**, **State wiring**, **Accessibility**, **Loading states**, **Route guards**. Full item definitions in `references/main.md` section **"Integration Checklist"**.

### 3.5.3 Integration Commit

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "feat(sprint-${N}/integration): UI/UX integration pass"
```

---

## Phase 4: INTEGRATE — Merge and Verify

### 4.1 Merge Worktree Branches

Merge each agent's branch into the sprint branch:
```bash
git checkout -b sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}/merged
git merge sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}/backend --no-edit
git merge sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}/frontend --no-edit
git merge sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}/tests --no-edit
# Handle merge conflicts if any
```

### 4.2 Full Build Verification (Selective Re-Runs)

Run the initial full verification sweep (type-check, lint, test, build). On re-runs during Phase 4.3 fix iterations, use the selective re-verification strategy in `references/main.md` section **"Selective Re-Verification Strategy"**. The final fix round always gets one full sweep to catch cross-package regressions.

### 4.2.5 Completeness Gate

Run the completeness gate on all files changed during the sprint:
```bash
# Collect all files modified in this sprint
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}/base..HEAD -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.vue')
```
Invoke: `/blitz:completeness-gate` with the sprint's source directories.
If the score is below C (70), flag critical findings in the integration report but do not block — the sprint review will make the final call.

### 4.2.1 Cross-Phase Regression Testing

If `SPRINT_NUMBER > 1`, run regression tests from prior sprints. Full procedure (pre-existing test identification, selective run, fix rounds, report schema) in `references/main.md` section **"Cross-Phase Regression Testing"**.

### 4.3 Fix Integration Issues

If verification fails:
1. Categorize errors (type errors, import errors, test failures, build errors).
2. Fix systematically — types first, then imports, then logic, then tests.
3. Max 5 fix iterations. If still failing, report remaining issues.
4. Commit each fix round:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix(sprint-${N}): resolve integration issues — round ${ROUND}"
   ```

### 4.4 Clean Up Worktrees

If agents were spawned with `isolation: "worktree"`, worktrees with no changes are automatically cleaned up when agents complete. For worktrees that persist (because they have changes):

1. List remaining worktrees: `git worktree list`
2. After successful merge (Phase 4.1), remove merged worktrees:
   ```bash
   for ROLE in backend frontend tests infra; do
     WT=".worktrees/sprint-${SPRINT_NUMBER}/${ROLE}"
     if [ -d "$WT" ]; then
       git worktree remove "$WT" --force 2>&1 || \
         echo "WARNING: Could not remove worktree $WT — check for uncommitted changes"
     fi
   done
   ```
3. Log any removal failures to the activity feed as `warning` events.

### 4.5 E2E Verification (Best-Effort)

After build verification passes, run an automated browser smoke test if Playwright MCP is available:

1. **Check availability**: Verify Playwright MCP tools are accessible.
2. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev &` (or equivalent). Wait for ready signal.
3. **Smoke test changed routes**: Identify changed page files from the diff. Navigate to the first 10 routes.
4. **Evaluate results**:
   - 0 Critical + 0 Error = **PASS**
   - 1+ Critical = **CONDITIONAL** — include findings in sprint report
   - 1+ Error only = **PASS with notes**
5. **Clean up**: Kill the dev server process.

Skip gracefully if Playwright is unavailable — document as a gap, not a failure.

### 4.6 Shutdown Team

Gracefully shutdown the development team. Send `HALT:` to any remaining agents.

### 4.7 Update Sprint Registry

**Registry Lock — `sprint-registry.json`**: Before writing, acquire a file-based lock per [session-protocol.md](/_shared/session-protocol.md):
1. CHECK if `sprint-registry.json.lock` exists — if stale (session completed/failed or >4h old with dead PID), delete it.
2. ACQUIRE by writing `sprint-registry.json.lock` with `{ "session_id": "${SESSION_ID}", "acquired": "<ISO-8601>" }`.
3. VERIFY by re-reading the lock file — confirm it contains YOUR `SESSION_ID`. If not, wait up to 60s (check every 5s), then ABORT with conflict report.
4. OPERATE — read, modify, and write the registry file.
5. RELEASE — delete `sprint-registry.json.lock` and append `lock_released` to the operation log.

Update `sprint-registry.json`:
```json
{
  "number": <N>,
  "status": "review",
  "completed_date": "<ISO-8601>",
  "stories_completed": <count>,
  "stories_blocked": <count>,
  "integration_issues": <count>
}
```

### 4.8 Update Story Statuses

For each story file, acquire `<story-file>.lock` before modifying the status field, then release after writing. This prevents concurrent sprint-review from reading partially-updated statuses.

For each story file, update frontmatter `status`:
- `done` — Implemented and passes verification.
- `incomplete` — Partially implemented or has failing tests.
- `blocked` — Could not be completed (circuit breaker triggered).

### 4.8.5 Blocked Story Accountability

For every story marked `blocked`:

1. **Document WHY** it was blocked (circuit breaker details, specific errors, missing dependencies).
2. **Document what work WAS completed** and what REMAINS.
3. **Create carry-forward entry** in the manifest's `carry_forward` array.
4. **Sprint summary MUST include a prominent warning** with blocked count and story IDs.

**Never silently drop blocked stories.** They must be visible in the sprint report and carry forward to the next sprint.

### 4.9 Final Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(sprint-${N}): complete sprint implementation — ${COMPLETED}/${TOTAL} stories"
git push origin HEAD
```

### 4.10 Final Output and Error Recovery

Print the summary block and apply recovery rules from `references/main.md` sections **"Final Output Template"** and **"Error Recovery"**.

### 4.11 Push Completion Notification

After the final commit and push, send a mobile push notification if Remote Control is enabled:

```
PushNotification(
  title: "Sprint ${N} complete ✓",
  message: "${COMPLETED}/${TOTAL} stories · ${BLOCKED} blocked · review ready",
  url: "https://github.com/<repo>/tree/sprint-${N}"
)
```

Call this unconditionally — if Remote Control is not configured the tool is a no-op. Do not gate on user confirmation; this is informational only.
