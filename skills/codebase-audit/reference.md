## Agent Prompt Template

Use this template for every audit agent. Replace `{PLACEHOLDERS}` with agent-specific values.

```markdown
You are a senior code auditor specializing in **{PILLAR}** ({PILLAR_SUBTITLE}).

## Your Assignment

**Scope**: {SCOPE}
**File Cap**: Examine up to {FILE_CAP} files.
**Output File**: {OUTPUT_PATH}

## Stack Context

{STACK_PROFILE}

## Entry Points to Start From

{ENTRY_POINTS}

## Audit Checklist

{PILLAR_CHECKLIST}

## Output Format

Write each finding using this exact format:

### FINDING: <short-title>

- **Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
- **File**: <relative-path>
- **Line(s)**: <line-range or "N/A">
- **Pillar**: {PILLAR}
- **Category**: <checklist-category>
- **Description**: <2-4 sentences explaining the issue>
- **Evidence**: <code snippet or observation>
- **Recommendation**: <specific actionable fix>
- **Effort**: Trivial | Small | Medium | Large

---

## Rules

1. Write each finding to your output file AS YOU DISCOVER IT. Do not accumulate.
2. Stay within your file cap. Prioritize the most impactful files.
3. Read files fully before judging — do not flag issues based on file names alone.
4. Be specific: cite exact file paths, line numbers, and code snippets.
5. Do not report style-only issues unless they indicate a deeper problem.
6. If you find a security vulnerability, always mark it Critical or High.
7. Cross-reference related files (e.g., a component and its store) to find integration issues.
8. At the end of your findings, write a brief summary section:

### SUMMARY

- **Files Examined**: <count>
- **Findings**: <count> (Critical: N, High: N, Medium: N, Low: N)
- **Top Concern**: <one-sentence summary of the most important finding>
- **Overall Assessment**: <one-sentence pillar health assessment>
```

## 5-Pillar Audit Checklists

### Pillar 1: Architecture

#### Frontend Scope (arch-frontend)
- [ ] **Component hierarchy**: Are components organized by feature/domain or flat? Is there a clear hierarchy (pages > layouts > composites > atoms)?
- [ ] **Prop drilling**: Are props passed through more than 2 levels? Should state management or provide/inject be used instead?
- [ ] **Store design**: Are stores organized by domain? Do stores have single responsibilities? Are cross-store dependencies managed?
- [ ] **Composable patterns**: Are composables pure (no side effects in setup)? Do they follow the `use*` naming convention?
- [ ] **Router structure**: Are routes organized logically? Are guards/middleware applied consistently? Are lazy-loaded appropriately?
- [ ] **Circular dependencies**: Are there circular imports between modules?
- [ ] **Barrel exports**: Are index files used consistently? Do they cause tree-shaking issues?
- [ ] **Layout consistency**: Is there a single layout system or competing approaches?
- [ ] **API boundary**: Is there a clear boundary between UI and data layers?
- [ ] **Feature coupling**: Do features import from each other directly, or through shared modules?

#### Backend Scope (arch-backend)
- [ ] **Function organization**: Are cloud functions grouped by domain? Is there a consistent naming scheme?
- [ ] **Schema placement**: Are data schemas co-located with their consumers or centralized?
- [ ] **Package boundaries**: Are internal packages properly encapsulated with clear public APIs?
- [ ] **Dependency direction**: Do dependencies flow inward (domain < application < infrastructure)?
- [ ] **Shared code**: Is code shared between frontend and backend properly isolated in shared packages?
- [ ] **Configuration management**: Are configs externalized? Are there hardcoded values that should be environment variables?
- [ ] **API versioning**: Is there a strategy for API versioning or backward compatibility?
- [ ] **Database access patterns**: Is data access centralized through repositories/services or scattered?
- [ ] **Middleware chain**: Is middleware applied consistently? Are cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, validation) separated?
- [ ] **Module coupling**: Can modules be deployed/tested independently?

### Pillar 2: Performance

#### Frontend Scope (perf-frontend)
- [ ] **Re-renders**: Are reactive references stable? Are computed properties used where applicable instead of methods?
- [ ] **Memory leaks**: Are event listeners, intervals, and subscriptions cleaned up in `onUnmounted`?
- [ ] **Bundle size**: Are there large libraries imported where a smaller alternative exists? Is tree-shaking effective?
- [ ] **Lazy loading**: Are below-the-fold components and routes lazy-loaded?
- [ ] **Image optimization**: Are images properly sized, formatted (WebP/AVIF), and lazy-loaded?
- [ ] **Virtual scrolling**: Are large lists (100+ items) virtualized?
- [ ] **Watchers**: Are deep watchers used unnecessarily? Could they be shallow or use specific property paths?

### Pillar 3: Security

#### Rules Scope (sec-rules)

- [ ] **Rule complexity**: Are rules maintainable? Are custom functions used to reduce duplication?

#### Code Scope (sec-code)
- [ ] **XSS prevention**: Is user input sanitized before rendering? Are `v-html` or `innerHTML` used with unsanitized data?
- [ ] **Auth middleware**: Are all protected routes guarded? Is the auth state checked server-side, not just client-side?
- [ ] **Input validation**: Is all user input validated on the server side? Are validation schemas used?

## Finding Severity Schema

### Critical
**Definition**: Immediate risk of security breach, data loss, or production outage.
**Examples**: Unauthenticated admin endpoints, SQL injection, unprotected PII, missing transaction rollback on financial operations.
**Action**: Must fix before next release.
**Score weight**: 10

### High
**Definition**: Significant quality issue that will cause user-facing problems or major technical debt.
**Examples**: N+1 queries on paginated lists, missing error boundaries on critical flows, permissive CORS in production, components over 500 lines.
**Action**: Fix within current sprint or next sprint.
**Score weight**: 5

### Medium
**Definition**: Code quality concern that increases maintenance burden or degrades experience over time.
**Examples**: Inconsistent naming, moderate code duplication, missing loading states on secondary views, untyped function parameters.
**Action**: Address in dedicated cleanup epic.
**Score weight**: 2

### Low
**Definition**: Improvement suggestion that would enhance code quality but has minimal user or security impact.
**Examples**: Suboptimal import ordering, missing JSDoc on internal utilities, slightly verbose code that could be more concise.
**Action**: Address opportunistically or during related work.
**Score weight**: 1

## Health Score Calculation

Per-pillar health score (0-100):

```
raw_penalty = sum(critical * 10 + high * 5 + medium * 2 + low * 1)
file_count = number of files examined by the pillar's agents
normalized_penalty = raw_penalty / max(file_count, 1)
health_score = max(0, 100 - (normalized_penalty * 5))
```

Overall health score = average of all 5 pillar scores.

Interpretation:
- **90-100**: Excellent — minor improvements only
- **70-89**: Good — some areas need attention
- **50-69**: Fair — significant issues to address
- **30-49**: Poor — major remediation needed
- **0-29**: Critical — fundamental problems present
